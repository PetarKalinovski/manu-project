NYT, 2015:  &gt;  ##Between the 14th hole and the 15th tee of one of the club’s two courses, Mr. Trump installed a flagpole on a stone pedestal overlooking the Potomac, to which he affixed a plaque purportedly designating **“The River of Blood.”**  &gt;##“Many great American soldiers, both of the North and South, died at this spot,” the inscription reads. “The casualties were so great that the water would turn red and thus became known as ‘The River of Blood.’ ”  &gt;##The inscription, beneath his family crest and above Mr. Trump’s full name, concludes: “It is my great honor to have preserved this important section of the Potomac River!”  &gt;“Nothing like that ever happened there,” said Richard Gillespie, the executive director of the Mosby Heritage Area Association.  &gt; In a phone interview, Mr. Trump called himself a “a big history fan” but deflected, played down and then simply disputed the local historians’ assertions of historical fact.  &gt; “That was a prime site for river crossings,” Mr. Trump said. “So, if people are crossing the river, and you happen to be in a civil war, I would say that people were shot — a lot of them.”  &gt; “How would they know that?” Mr. Trump asked when told that local historians had called his plaque a fiction. “Were they there?”  &gt; Mr. Trump repeatedly said that “numerous historians” had told him that the golf club site was known as the River of Blood. But he said he did not remember their names.  &gt; Then he said the historians had spoken not to him but to “my people.” But he refused to identify any underlings who might still possess the historians’ names.  &gt; “Write your story the way you want to write it,” Mr. Trump said finally, when pressed unsuccessfully for anything that could corroborate his claim. “You don’t have to talk to anybody. It doesn’t make any difference. But many people were shot. It makes sense.”  still a bit too early to judge if Trump will become more Presidential in office. How about we give him another term what do you say guys\",\n",

For example here\\'s Trump on the stockmarket - \"All business is just at the beginning of something really special!\" That is the Coke Zero of sentences, there\\'s nothing in it but fizz.   Sometimes his waterbugging is blatantly silly enough to get media attention, usually because of his batshit insane use of superlatives (\"Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody who\\'s done an amazing job &amp; is being recognized more and more\") but often people just let him skate even though his speech is littered with \"You have\"-s, \"People are telling me\"-s and other flotsam.   He also habitually truncates meaningful sentences into meaningless ones -  Trump will indicate an entire clause or phrase by just invoking the first noun or adjective in that phrase and tripping over any other parts of speech. For example \"We must end chain and lottery\" - chain and lottery what? [Immigration] \"My uncle explained to me about the nuclear [power].\"   Sometimes verbs even lose their objects, **which comes pretty close to indicating that Donald Trump doesn\\'t fucking understand how parts of speech work:** \"Nobody said I would disavow [David Duke] but I disavowed [him].\" Trump typically grabs one word in an interview and does a verbal Maypole dance around it, repeating it over and over, and this often creates a \"book report by kid who didn\\'t read the book\" effect.  remember I wrote that two years ago.  And now -  ##**[Trump last month:](https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/1271493719749844992?lang=en)** \"I think the concept of chokehold sounds so innocent, so perfect.\"  ##**[Trump yesterday:](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/transcript-fox-news-sunday-interview-with-president-trump)** \"They got a lot wrong.

       "  '**The problem is we have a political generation raised by Ron Paul and Bernie Sanders**. Bunch of late-Millennials and Zoomers who think doing a \"moneybomb\" online for their candidate means winning. Half of Bernie culture was just repeating and celebrating statistics about how many email nag donations he gathered. The fact that Paul and Sanders did nothing but lose *on election day* didn\\'t seem to sink in.   If you want to study how progressive change actually happens look at Obamacare.   It passed because we had **13 Democratic Senators voting yes in states Obama had lost to McCain:**  - 2 in Montana - 2 in North Dakota - 1 in South Dakota - 1 in Nebraska - 1 in Missouri - 2 in Arkansas - 1 in Louisiana - 2 in West Virginia - 1 in Alaska  As well as 6 more Yes votes from Democratic Senators in **states Kerry had lost to Bush just a few years before,** albeit Obama won them:  - 2 in Virginia - 1 in Ohio - 1 in Indiana - 1 in North Carolina - 1 in Iowa  In our Obamacare-passing Senate coalition of 60 Yes votes, fully one third (19) were from **states where Democrats LOST** to Bush in 2004, just one Senate term before the passage of Obamacare in 2010.  The lesson is really clear. If you want progressive change in the country, you get it by electing Democratic Senators in Trump states who are decoupled from national politics and represent genuinely moderate politics (and who then \"betray\" their voters by loyally staking their careers on structurally progressive legislation like Obamacare, often times losing their seats in the process).   You can\\'t just parachute coastal-liberal money into red states to back coastal-liberal candidates and hope that Ted Cruz\\'s or Lindsey Graham\\'s horrible approval ratings will do the work for you. You don\\'t get progressive change by electing Beto O\\'Rourkes or Jon Ossoffs, you get it by electing Max Baucuses and Claire McCaskillses. Candidates who the average Reddit zoomer will hate and think is \"owned by corporations\" or whatever. Candidates whose only exposure on Reddit will be 40k upvotes of screenshots of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Twitter-dunking them for not being Socialist enough. Those are the candidates who will actually accomplish change.  Once this lesson sinks in you also see how the nationalization of our politics down to the dogcatcher level has seriously advantaged the Republicans. Sure, they can\\'t win a national election as long as they are the FOX News party. But as long as every Senate race goes the same direction as the Presidential ticket, they can also indefinitely stop a Democratic majority (or at best give up a 52-54 seat majority from time to time that can\\'t accomplish structural change). And their permanent minority status at the Presidential level is buffered by the electoral college, giving them pretty decent odds at elections where they lose the popular vote by *millions*.',\n",

       "  '**While I detest Trump**, this article rising to the top is a great example of why I stopped using arrpolitics.  For nearly every media source, the rules on how strident and incendiary **op-ed titles** can be are looser than how inflammatory actual **news headlines** can be. But because people in this place just upvote titles without reading articles, **op-ed pieces rise to the top over actual news.**   The same phenomenon explains why bad quality news sources with less rigorous journalistic practices rise to the top over more reputable news sources. Even when they both publish something in the same hour on the same breaking story, you\\'ll usually see tabloids, even foreign tabloids, rising to the top over pieces from America\\'s newspapers of record. Why? Because of more incendiary phrasing of the same news content.  And because Reddit drives millions of clicks, this place is not just observing the degradation of news quality - it\\'s driving it. Just think about that one guy at Esquire who writes a \"Trump is a doodoo\" op-ed article every weekend. Just by coming up with a snarky headline every 7 days he drives thousands of more clicks than an actual Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist, [David Farenthold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Fahrenthold), wearing out his shoe leather to track down all of Trump\\'s \"charity\" frauds.  Reddit is a motive force in turning news writing into political cartoons. The virtues of a Reddit-upvotable news headline are the same virtues of a \"good\" political cartoon: short, hyperpartisan, snarky, merciless to one\\'s enemies, bad faith, and only considers opposing points of view with the goal of finding the quickest nitpick to \"own\" them.   I always find it interesting whenever I see any post here about the distinction between entertainment and news because that tells me someone is over 30. The idea of keeping news separate from partisan screeching is water over the dam at this point; not only can we not undo FOX News anymore, but Reddit is finishing FOX\\'s job. Someone who was raised on a media diet provided by Reddit would be exactly, 100% as incapable of distinguishing op-ed from newsroom as someone raised on FOX. I even see posts on here sometimes \"replying\" to a particular piece of news saying \"well so-and-so paper hates Bernie so...\" as if (EVEN if that were true) a paper\\'s editorial stance has relevance to their newsroom reporting.',\n",

       "  \"Yeah. The thing is though, we are in an era where the conventional wisdom is peeling away from reality. An example is when people say Trump can't get re-elected because he has a low approval rating. Well, approval rating used to be a good predictor of re-election chances but it's becomes less relevant as people become more partisan. If you'd vote a ham sandwich over a Republican you don't care if you approve of the ham sandwich or not. And that's what we already saw when Trump was very narrowly able to get elected with something like a 37% approval rating on election day. It seems totally conceivable he could get re-elected with a 43% approval rating even though that defies conventional wisdom.  Something very similar is going on with political fundraising, especially **ONLINE political fundraising.** Bernie and his voters talk a big game about fighting the media but they are in love with the post-Obama conventional media wisdom that big online fundraising = this is the candidate to pay attention to. I'm much more skeptical of that idea. In 2004 and 2008, online political fundraising used to be a sign that your long shot candidate was actually generating underground enthusiasm where no one could see. But hey, it's 2020 now and everyone can see that Bernie and Yang are generating millions of YouTube hits, yet combined they poll 18%. In 2004 and 2008, online political fundraising was a proxy for activism. Because people were reluctant to give their financial details online, so someone who was willing to put their credit card in their computer for Obama was someone who was likely willing to actually volunteer in the real world, hold Obama parties, canvass their neighborhoods, do get-out-the-vote activities on election night, and attend a long and grueling caucus. By contrast in 2020 everyone pays for stuff online all the time, especially via subscriptions, so it's not a big deal that you're able to raise $5 at a time from millions of people with your campaign's online newsletter. We already saw this in 2016 when Bernie raised huge sums online and yet when it came to real world activism, his campaign was sucky garbage at voter registration, GOTV, canvassing, everything. They were good at phonebanking because you don't have to leave the house, and they were AMAZING at photoshopping the bird that landed on Bernie's podium.\",\n",

Total political spending in the 2016 cycle totaled 6.5 billion for all presidential and congressional campaigns so that's less than $0.33 in political spending for every $1,000 in the US economy. That's pretty low spending considering the tremendous and arbitrary power the US government can wield over the economy and people's lives. Just look at Trump's trade war. How many billions of dollars was it worth it to farmers, consumers and other actors in the US economy to avoid Trump being president and taking us on this crazy trade war? Or look at Sanders proposing THOUSANDS OF BILLIONS of dollars in new spending over the next decade; presumably avoiding that fate is worth the same amount collectively among people who will be taxed to pay for it. Yet political spending remains low. Perhaps because the diminishing returns of political spending are extreme. People complain all the time about there being too much money in politics yet I can tell you right now that if the Democratic presidential candidate magically got $20 billion of free money to legally spend on the campaign, a Republican would still get 45% of the vote minimum and vice versa.\",\n",

       "  'People gotta realize one thing -  #### **foreign intelligence is older than gunpowder.**   Most states have had intelligence agents in one form or another for centuries before police forces or standing armies.  The intelligence services have had *centuries* to figure out what factors are most likely to make an individual act against their country\\'s interest.  In the USA we call this **M.I.C.E.**   - **M**oney (or lifestyle) - **I**deology (or disaffection / disillusionment) - **C**oercion (or compromise / blackmail) - **E**go (or status / influence / social proof)  If someone is recruitable it\\'ll most likely be one or a combination of these factors. It\\'s just a matter of deciding which lever is most likely to work.  In the Trump administration ***Ego*** is going to be a big factor - and ***not*** because I think everyone that works for Trump is a narcissist. It\\'s rather because Trump has a hollow administration, with many senior posts lacking even Senate nominations.   [Ironically, the hollow administration bubbled up in the news again this week](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/11/trump-on-unfilled-jobs-i-am-the-only-one-who-matters.html). But there have been a barrage of news articles, going back to February, about this unprecedented low-staffing situation. So this hasn\\'t gone unnoticed by foreign observers. In addition, if we\\'re talking about the campaign, everyone saw the hollow administration coming - at that time, it was called the **\"Never Trumper\"** or refuse-to-join movement.  Trump\\'s hollow administration exists because of four factors - any one of these would hurt, but they\\'re a perfect storm in combination -  - Trump\\'s policy ideas lack buy-in from the wider Republican world of institutions &amp; experts  - Trump has zero executive or legislative experience and hasn\\'t formed relationships  - Trump is a chaotic manager who has a mutually distrustful relationship with the executive branch agencies  - Trump\\'s administration is under criminal investigation  All of these things dissuade people from working for Trump.   As President, Trump has built a cancerously White-House-centered operation, often bypassing or throwing shade on his own Cabinet. He governs by tweet and whoever gets closest to him - regardless of their qualifications or official position - governs what he tweets. Not only is this proven (as in the many cases where Trump immediately tweets about a certain subject immediately, as in minutes, after a TV program about that subject aired) but *Trump makes no effort to disguise it.*   All of this constitutes what we could call the  ### **Mar-a-Lago-ization**   of the federal government - the construction of an **informal** process alongside the **official** process and *deliberately* signalling that all real power rests in the informal process. Once you understand this is happening, examples abound. For example there\\'s a Reddit headline right now about Trump simultaneously declaring Native American Month and tweeting a racist Indian slur at a Senator. Official, unofficial - get it? This was also on full display when Trump gave \"official\" and \"unofficial\" responses to the Charlottesville attack. The media was confused by Trump\\'s mixed messaging but Trump\\'s base understood that Teleprompter Trump *is a Nothing.* Totally meaningless. Meanwhile, \"Real Trump\" made very clear how he felt.  So we have the cultivation of an informal process of government in a hollow, closed-circle administration with low staffing. **Now look at all of this through the eyes of a foreign intelligence agent.** What levers do you see in this situation? Money, Ideology, Coercion, or Ego?  That\\'s right - **Ego** is the big one. There is a huge Ego incentive for low level policy aides like Papa Dop. You can see the appeal for a 30 year old guy of being potentially \"Trump\\'s point man\" on an entire country, to say nothing of that country being Russia, and it seems likely that his \"The Professor\" contact wormtongued exactly that into his ear: **\"Think of all the rungs you could skip!\"** The fact that Trump visibly rewards loyalty (Sessions is AG solely because he was first GOP to endorse) regardless of qualifications (look at Hope Hicks) doubles the enticement.   I would not be surprised if many younger, low level Trump aides have been \"recruited\" in this way. Not just by our enemies like Russia btw.',\n",

Cruz had three or four Super PACs supporting him called [\"Keep The Promise 1\", \"Keep The Promise 2,\"](https://ballotpedia.org/Keep_the_Promise_Super_PACs) etc. The PACs were separate silos because each one was for a different megadonor, ensuring that each donor had tight control over how their money was spent. In fact, because of the dumb rules in Citizen\\'s United about \"coordination,\" the Cruz campaign technically wasn\\'t allowed to coordinate with the PACs at all - [that meant that when Cruz wanted to give the PACs video footage of his family to use in ads, for instance, his campaign had to upload the videos publicly to a little-seen YouTube channel](http://nymag.com/selectall/2015/12/ted-cruz-raw-and-uncut.html). Anyway! \"Keep The Promise #1\" was Robert Mercer\\'s PAC. Guess who ran it? everyone\\'s favorite Skeletor cosplay, **Kellyanne Conway.** After Cruz was toast, in June 2016 the organization filed with the FEC to rename itself [Make America Number 1](https://ballotpedia.org/Make_America_Number_1). On July 1 the Trump campaign hired Conway and on August 17 she was promoted to campaign manager replacing Corey Lewandowski. The new boss of KTP1/MAN1 throughout July and August became David Bossie, formerly the president of Citizens United. By September, Bossie was also hired by the Trump campaign to be deputy campaign manager under Conway. What pattern does this look like? It looks like  #**the Mercers took over Trump\\'s campaign from the inside after Cruz lost.**   Did you ever wonder how Ted Cruz went from making his \"vote your conscience\" speech at the convention to his groveling endorsement of Trump weeks later?

The Mercers rode Cruz like a mule and when his legs gave out they hopped all of their money and staff to the Trump Train.  Every time I see the Mercers discussed on Reddit people do always remember the Breitbart and Cambridge Analytica angles, but for some reason nobody mentions the Cruz SuperPACs and Kellyanne.   What is very interesting to me is that if you look at the timelines, it\\'s possible that there may be more than one faction of people who had a \"Russian connection,\" and more than one faction of people who knew nothing about it. When we\\'re talking about all these people in Trump World I think one of the most important question is who brought them on board. For example every time we talk about Mike Flynn we have to remember he was a \"Sessions Person.\" So is Sam Clovis. While someone like Hope Hicks is a \"TrumpOrg Person.\" Ultimately, whatever happened, it was being led from the top of one of these pyramids - and we have to be ready for the idea that someone like Sessions or Mercer and not necessarily Donald Trump himself, came up with the plot initially. Of course, that doesn\\'t mean he shouldn\\'t be impeached. He still was involved and still tried to cover it all up.',\n",

Disarray is just what realignment is called by people who stand to lose from realignment - realignment of legislative priorities, of the party\\'s rhetoric and shorthand language, and of the relative power of each faction within the party.   And all of this applies to Trump as well. Trump is, horrifyingly, a more honest reflection of what the people who vote GOP truly want than the GOP\\'s leadership has ever been able to admit to themselves. Trump didn\\'t throw the Republican Party into disarray, he just showed that the old Reagan era shibboleths were inoperative for today\\'s Republican voters. He also showed that the Christian conservatives were busted as a political force in the GOP.

He has partially authoritarian traits: a [social dominance orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_dominance_orientation), high egotism and willingness to instrumentalize others, low empathy, scores high on \"dangerous world\" scale, etc.   But his core outlook is opportunist and self centered. He\\'s an authoritarian maimed and hobbled by narcissism. He has a keen eye for \"group thinking\"; he is able to identify the most unpopular, punchable groups; and he can command a megaphone. But ultimately he uses these skills to direct attention towards or (in this case) away from his personal affairs. There\\'s no coherent vision behind it. His Muslim ban wasn\\'t the product of long thought, it was a hastily put together campaign pledge created 12 hours after a domestic terror attack as a way to \"outflank\" Cruz and others on the Strong On Terra issue.   Social conservatives and alt-right authoritarians may believe Trump is delivering for them, but it\\'s all a house of cards. There\\'s no commitment or follow through behind these policies. Trump has changed his own foreign policy several times, on Twitter, in the space of 24 hours. The Trump policy making machine boils down to a 24 hour feedback loop between Donald Trump, his Twitter account, news reaction to his pronouncements, and the cable morning panel shows the day after.

This video shows exactly why Obama was a great President. He could sit for 3 minutes and talk about a problem that affected ordinary people, sum it up with both facts and emotion, and lay out what actions we needed to take. And yes, sometimes he was reading off a teleprompter, because he didn\\'t do everything, he was a team leader leading a government full of people also trying to do the right thing. His administration never even took credit for half the good things they did; it never crossed Barack Obama\\'s mind to call it Obamacare. Half of it disappeared down the memory hole thanks to ineffectual or momentary victory laps like this web video that a grand total of 23,000 people saw on Youtube and Twitter combined.  Compare with Donald Trump. He took advantage of a domestic terrorist attack to issue a flagrantly unConstitutional and unAmerican campaign \"pledge\" because he\\'s 50% circus ringmaster 50% born authoritarian. Then when he gets into office he looks at his list of five people who actually endorsed him *before* he won the nomination (two of whom are his daughter and son in law) and throws a dart at his rolodex. It comes up 9iu11iani so he calls up the Rudmeister on his unsecured personal cell phone, like a President does, and barks at him  \"Draw up the plans for this, because I am unqualified for this office and could not draft a bill or an executive order if you promised me my daughter\\'s hand in marriage, so I need to literally outsource and delegate every single function of this job.\" The Rudmeister says \"No problem Mr. President God Emperor and I\\'ll make sure to do it legal like, wink wink,\" a reference that is lost on Trump because he literally believes the President cannot commit a crime. So the policy gets drafted, sort of. Then the White House takes a concerted effort to keep that plan *secret from the agency that will be in charge of enforcing it* because they know they have no buy-in from the career civil service who swore oaths to the Constitution. The result of the policy \"roll out\" is chaos across the country and a multi-venue legal battle that ends up in the Supreme Court. Tired of winning yet? ',\n",

       "  'Oh please. Every, fucking, day on Reddit I see people posting \"DNC email dump proves they were sabotaging Bernie\" when the smoking-gunniest email in the entire dump is some staffer grousing IN APRIL 2016 about how Bernie was being stubborn and hadn\\'t conceded yet. Let\\'s look at the facts. Sanders at that point had already lost Super Tuesday and Super Tuesday II. he was behind by 100s of pledged delegates and needed to win approximately 68% of the vote in every large state yet to vote just to TIE Hillary in pledged delegates. What were his actual results in the remaining large states after that email was written? 41% in New York, 41.6% in Pennsylvania, 46% in California. By the way those results are closely in line with the polling that had been done in the major primary states throughout the spring. Go to the SandersForPrez archives and you can see people posting absolutely embarrassing crap like \"We\\'re down only 20 points in New York with 1 month to go! We can do it! Nothing is impossible! Whisper of a dream! Wait what do you mean the voter registration deadline in New York was yesterday?!?!?! I WAS BUSY PHOTOSHOPPING BIRDS I DIDN\\'T KNOW WE HAD TO DO REAL LIFE ACTIVITIES TO WIN AN ELECTION!!!\"  I don\\'t blame any politically literate person for calling the contest in April and if the SandersForPrez subreddit refuses to admit that Sanders was electorally doomed at the time the staffer wrote that email, that\\'s just one more sign that they\\'re living in a fantasy world. At worst you could throw the hypocrite card at HRC supporters because Hillary also refused (back in 2008) to concede until looong after the outcome was certain. She even blew racial dogwhistles about Obama saying that \"hard working White Americans\" were in her camp and that it would be foolish to resign her campaign before the very last state voted considering \"what happened to RFK,\" which certainly was shitter hardball than anything Bernie threw at Hillary in \\'16. But actually, despite also being a no-hope candidate by around May-June 2008, she was closer in pledged delegates to Obama than Bernie ever got to Hillary. So I find no real reason to consider the staffer\\'s email inappropriate.  Reddit is full of people smugly noting how Twitter and Facebook got played by fake news narratives but if you point out how Bernie Sanders supporters ARE STILL laboring under false narratives that we have *evidence* were furthered and propagated, if not originated, by Russian active measures you get downvoted.   The truth is the Sanders campaign wasn\\'t sabotaged, it was just a bad campaign. The campaign suffered from many of the same flaws as the campaign by Reddit\\'s previous golden boy Ron Paul.   1. You had a candidate who was more used to being an iconoclastic backbencher than actually leading.   2. You had supporters who obsessed over the exact clock time their candidate got at debates while ignoring that he muffed opening after opening to go after his opponents, constantly redirected questions back to his pet issues instead of displaying a breadth of knowledge, and just generally didn\\'t present well.   3. You had a campaign that was FUCKING DELUGED with internet driven small donations but did not have the expertise or organization to marshal those resources effectively.   4. You had a grassroots movement that was more obsessed with conspiracy theories, delegate rules arcana, and fantasies about broken conventions than the hard work of knocking doors and registering voters.   5. Above all you had a candidate who spoke for a faction within his party and did almost nothing to build out his base into the wider party, being genuinely convinced that the attention he was finally getting was itself evidence that the time for his ideas had come.  It literally was Ron Paul all over again. I was waiting for them to buy a blimp with GOOGLE BERNIE SANDERS on it. Anyone who was surprised by the result, I just am nonplussed by that unless it was your very first election cycle or the first time you got excited by a candidate.',\n",

Leak the facts NOW and the memo looks like obvious horseshit when it\\'s released. That\\'s what we saw starting yesterday evening and now this morning.  Just remember with regard to the IC, that they know everything and all releases are timed for effect. The media is not \"discovering\" this piece by piece. There has been a repeated pattern of stories dropping when Trump is in the air to/from foreign trips.   - The Trump Tower meeting was revealed when Trump was flying.   - The early-June firing attempt on Mueller was revealed when Trump went to Davos.   - Here\\'s one more example. Do you remember [when Paul Ryan gave a press conference in early morning May 17 that there shouldn\\'t be a special counsel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsYnzDyXrGo) and then that afternoon Rosenstein appointed Mueller? Yes, but what else happened that day? [The Washington Post published a tape showing Ryan and House leadership talking about how they\\'re convinced \"Putin pays Rohrabacher and Trump.\"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/house-majority-leader-to-colleagues-in-2016-i-think-putin-pays-trump/2017/05/17/515f6f8a-3aff-11e7-8854-21f359183e8c_story.html?utm_term=.08239818d9c6) That was just a little pre-emptive body check to make sure Paul Ryan didn\\'t try anything stupid using his powers as House Speaker.  The conclusion you should draw is that THEY HAVE EVERYTHING ALREADY. The Mueller \"investigation\" does not really exist, at least its counterintelligence prong doesn\\'t exist (the process crimes prong, where they get Trump admin officials to damn themselves with lies or flip on each other, is obviously ongoing). They could release the whole story tomorrow if they wanted. The reason this is taking multiple years is because they have to slow-walk the public through each chapter of the story and let each part seep in and have media impact. Can you imagine if one year ago today you told someone on the street that Trump\\'s son met with Russian agents at Trump Tower to discuss dropping sanctions in exchange for Hillary dirt, that his national security adviser entertained a plot to kidnap a dictator\\'s political opponent on US soil to render them illegally for a show trial, that his campaign was in repeated email contact with Wikileaks, that his son in law asked Russian intelligence to set up a back channel that couldn\\'t be spied on by US agencies, and that the President had repeatedly asked law enforcement officials if they were going to be \"loyal\" to him?

There is clearly a part of Trump\\'s brain, we can label it the \"Ted Cruz\\'s Dad\" Lobe, that would react more or less as guilty-looking-ly as Trump is reacting *even in the case that Trump were totally innocent*, JUST because Trump simply cannot keep himself from reflexively attacking and smearing anyone who he perceives as attacking him. His over the top defensiveness does, in this case, seem to be consciousness of guilt but who can know with the guy? He doesn\\'t live in reality most of the time. Google the story about him inventing a Civil War battlefield for one of his golf courses.  With regard to the IC + GOP lawmakers, I think there\\'s a good chance that some GOP lawmakers are in the dark. We honestly don\\'t know yet if Mueller\\'s indictments will encompass Congress but there have been some signs in that direction.  I don\\'t believe there will ever be a situation where Pence becomes President. I think the last chapter of the drops will be \"Here\\'s a wrap up of the story of everything Trump did... and now we\\'re going to show you that Pence knew all along.\" That means Ryan is in line for the Presidency if Democrats do not retake the House. There are some complicated political calculations there. If Democrats take the House everything becomes easier. Either way, in my opinion, there will be a point where Trump either has to fire Rosenstein &amp; Mueller or pardon DonJr &amp; Kushner. He will choose to fire Mueller and that will be the trigger for the endgame. I do not think Mueller / IC are counting on Mueller getting to finish his investigation untroubled.',\n",

Out of all the candidates, I noticed these qualities the most in Mayor Pete. Generally he directly answers a debate question within the first one or two sentences of his response. Here’s some exact quotes (NO ellisions) from the last debate:  &gt; Q: Should voters take into consideration age when choosing a presidential candidate?  &gt; BUTTIGIEG: I don\\'t care how old you are. I care about your vision.  and:  &gt; Q: Will you withdraw all U.S. servicemembers [from Afghanistan] by the end of your first year in office?  &gt; BUTTIGIEG: We will withdraw. We have to.  &gt; Q: In your first year?  &gt; BUTTIGIEG: Yes.  and:  &gt;Q: Under Senator Sanders\\' proposal to cancel all student loan debt, yours would immediately be wiped away. Why wouldn\\'t you support that?  &gt; BUTTIGIEG: That would be great for us. And then the next day, there would be a student loan program and people would be out taking student loans wondering they weren\\'t lucky enough in timing to get theirs wiped away completely, too.  and:  &gt;Q: You are willing to raise taxes on middle-class Americans in order to have universal coverage with the disappearance of insurance premiums, yes or no?  &gt; BUTTIGIEG: I think you can buy into it. That\\'s the idea of Medicare for All Who Want It.  Buttigieg uses the rest of his time to expand his answer but he very often (not always, but markedly often) answers the question directly and honestly in his first few words.  The thing that to my mind unites all the Democrats except Buttigieg is **they have all been shown to be quite bad at defending their ideas and records under attack.**  **Joe Biden** was under a hail of attacks in both debates and he just did his laugh-and-deflect thing.  **Kamala Harris** briefly built herself a mythos as an Obama-style candidate but that came tumbling down when Gabbard attacked her in the 2nd debate. See if YOU think this is an effective defense of one\\'s record:  &gt; GABBARD: I want to bring the conversation back to the broken criminal justice system that is disproportionately negatively impacting black and brown people all across this country today. Now Senator Harris says she’s proud of her record as a prosecutor and that she’ll be a prosecutor president. But I’m deeply concerned about this record. There are too many examples to cite but she put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana. She blocked evidence—she blocked evidence that would have freed an innocent man from death row until the courts forced her to do so. She kept people in prison beyond their sentences to use them as cheap labor for the state of California. And she fought to keep the bail system in place that impacts poor people in the worst kind of way.  &gt; HARRIS: As the elected attorney general of California, I did the work of significantly reforming the criminal justice system of a state of 40 million people, which became a national model for the work that needs to be done. And I am proud of that work. And I am proud of making a decision to not just give fancy speeches or be in a legislative body and give speeches on the floor, but actually doing the work of being in the position to use the power that I had to reform a system that is badly in need of reform. That is why we created initiatives that were about reentering former offenders and getting them counseling.  It is why and because I know that criminal justice system is so broken. That I am an advocate for what we need to do to not only decriminalize, but legalize marijuana in the United States.  &gt; GABBARD: The bottom line is, Senator Harris, when you were in a position to make a difference and an impact in these people’s lives, you did not. And worse yet, in the case of those who were on death row, innocent people, you actually blocked evidence from being revealed that would have freed them until you were forced to do so. There is no excuse for that and the people who suffered under your reign as prosecutor owe—you owe them an apology.  &gt; HARRIS: My entire career I have been opposed—personally opposed to the death penalty and that has never changed. And I dare anybody who is in a position to make that decision, to face the people I have faced to say I will not seek the death penalty. That is my background, that is my work. I am proud of it. I think you can judge people by when they are under fire and it’s not about some fancy opinion on a stage but when they’re in the position to actually make a decision, what do they do. When I was in the position of having to decide whether or not to seek a death penalty on cases I prosecuted, I made a very difficult decision that was not popular to not seek the death penalty. History shows that and I am proud of those decisions.  yeah that was garbage. After the debate Gabbard was all over the media doing interviews and saying Harris never  addressed what she said. And the truth is whether Gabbard\\'s attacks were true or false, it\\'s indefensible to just stand there and say *\"I\\'m proud of the work that I did and I did the work\"* which is all that voters are gonna take away from this complete mess of an \"answer.\" I rate Harris zero Obamas out of ten.  And finally (ooh lordy is Reddit gonna hate me for this one) but in the 2nd debate we finally saw **Warren** and **Sanders** have to answer and defend their healthcare position from *fellow Democrats* who DO want healthcare as a right, DO want universal coverage, and simply want to follow the public option path because it doesn\\'t require the political nightmare of throwing 100+million Americans off their current plans. And instead of a policy debate we just saw them yell \"You can\\'t criticize me, that\\'s Republican talking points\" over and over for two hours. The only one of the pair who was even mildly quick-witted was Warren and her line against Delaney mostly worked because he\\'s polling at 1% and dropping. It\\'s a debate \"zinger\" the same way Donald Trump (who consistently led the polls from 3 weeks after he entered the race until he won the nomination) was able to supposedly \"destroy\" Jeb Bush. There wasn\\'t much to destroy. Sorry Liz you\\'re not going to be able to yell \"Republican talking points\" when you\\'re onstage at a townhall with Trump answering questions from an undecided voter.

The **\"keep looking at every detail of his life until we find something criminal\"** stuff  So let\\'s tackle those one by one.  1. IMO the Russia stuff will eventually trace back to Jeff Sessions. Because Sessions was the guy who introduced Donald to Carter Page, to Flynn, etc. I honestly doubt it goes higher than that. I think Trump has had Buchananite, isolationist foreign policy views his whole life, and he\\'s been deliberately groomed by Russia as a useful idiot, but he\\'s too fucking dumb to KNOW he\\'s being used. But:  2. The obstruction of justice stuff. Trump has already admitted to it on TV. Even if it wasn\\'t a *conspiratorial* coverup, it\\'s still a coverup. That is, Trump may have fired Comey because he fights anyone who criticizes or investigates him rather than because he specifically wanted to prevent Comey from finding out secret XYZ. It doesn\\'t matter much from an impeachment perspective.  3. The \"keep looking until we find something criminal\" stuff. So: Republicans are perfectly right to complain this is a wide-net fishing expedition. But also: FUCK THEM, they did this to Bill Clinton, they did this to Hillary Clinton, they would have done this to Barack Obama if he weren\\'t fucking whiter than Wayne Brady.

       "  'Top, top quality post /u/moral_agent  Just compare Trump to Obama. Some people have made fun of Obama\\'s teleprompter or the fact that he often speaks with deliberate hesitations and pauses when answering questions off the cuff. They\\'ve tried to make it out like Obama is just a speechifier with no mental substance, a man who flounders when he has to talk off the cuff. But the reality is Barack Obama is an incredibly thoughtful man who understands that he may be **the President**, but **the Presidency** is a time honored and continuing institution and he has to live up to its expectations, maintain its prestige and decorum, and pass it on to a successor. When Obama says something wrong, unprepared, or poorly thought out (Syria red line, for instance) it can not only have political consequences. It can affect the lives of people in this country and around the world. It can affect America\\'s global standing, our economic prospects, and our relations with other countries.  Barack Obama is a man who feels the weight of history on him.  I have got this sense from every President in my lifetime, even George W Bush (who was very conscious of his terrible speaking skills).   The Presidency is a Constitutional institution. That is why every defeated President and every defeated challenger in our lifetimes has - rather than call the election rigged - congratulated his opponent and **urged his own supporters** to pray for and/or support the next administration.  Here are just a few excerpts from election-night speeches by losing candidates.  &gt; ##MITT ROMNEY: This is a time of great challenges for America, and I pray that the president will be successful in guiding our nation. The nation, as you know, is at a critical point. At a time like this, we can’t risk partisan bickering and political posturing. Our leaders have to reach across the aisle to do the people’s work. And we citizens also have to rise to the occasion.  &gt; ##JOHN MCCAIN: A little while ago, I had the honor of calling Senator Barack Obama -- (boos) -- to congratulate him -- (boos) -- please -- to congratulate him on being elected the next president of the country that we both love. In a contest as long and difficult as this campaign has been, his success alone commands my respect for his ability and perseverance. But that he managed to do so by inspiring the hopes of so many millions of Americans who had once wrongly believed that they had little at stake or little influence in the election of an American president is something I deeply admire and commend him for achieving. It is natural -- it\\'s natural tonight to feel some disappointment, but tomorrow we must move beyond it and work together to get our country moving again. We fought as hard as we could. And though we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours. I would not be an American worthy of the name, should I regret a fate that has allowed me the extraordinary privilege of serving this country for a half a century. Today, I was a candidate for the highest office in the country I love so much. And tonight, I remain her servant. Tonight -- tonight, more than any night, I hold in my heart nothing but love for this country and for all its citizens, whether they supported me or Senator Obama -- whether they supported me or Senator Obama, I wish Godspeed to the man who was my former opponent and will be my president.  &gt; ##JOHN KERRY: I did my best to express my vision and my hopes for America. We worked hard and we fought hard, and I wish that things had turned out a little differently. But in an American election, there are no losers, because whether or not our candidates are successful, the next morning we all wake up as Americans. That is the greatest privilege and the most remarkable good fortune that can come to us on Earth. With that gift also comes obligation. We are required now to work together for the good of our country. In the days ahead, we must find common cause. We must join in common effort, without remorse or recrimination, without anger or rancor.   &gt; ##AL GORE: Almost a century and a half ago, senator Stephen Douglas told Abraham Lincoln, who had just defeated him for the presidency, \"Partisan feeling must yield to patriotism. I\\'m with you, Mr president, and God bless you.\" Well, in that same spirit, I say to president-elect Bush that what remains of partisan rancor must now be put aside, and may God bless his stewardship of this country. The US supreme court has spoken. Let there be no doubt, while I strongly disagree with the court\\'s decision, I accept it. I accept the finality of this outcome which will be ratified next Monday in the electoral college. And tonight, for the sake of our unity as a people and the strength of our democracy, I offer my concession. I also accept my responsibility, which I will discharge unconditionally, to honour the new president-elect and do everything possible to help him bring Americans together in fulfilment of the great vision that our Declaration of Independence defines and that our constitution affirms and defends. Some have expressed concern that the unusual nature of this election might hamper the next president in the conduct of his office. I do not believe it need be so. President-elect Bush inherits a nation whose citizens will be ready to assist him in the conduct of his large responsibilities. I personally will be at his disposal, and I call on all Americans - I particularly urge all who stood with us to unite behind our next president. This is America. Just as we fight hard when the stakes are high, we close ranks and come together when the contest is done. And while there will be time enough to debate our continuing differences, now is the time to recognise that that which unites us is greater than that which divides us. While we yet hold and do not yield our opposing beliefs, there is a higher duty than the one we owe to political party. This is America and we put country before party. We will stand together behind our new president.  Would Trump give such a speech? Is Trump BIOLOGICALLY CAPABLE of giving such a speech?  Not once, not fucking once have I ever felt that Donald Trump gets the Presidency. On the contrary, the news that Trump offered Kasich stewardship of \"foreign and domestic policy\" shows that Trump views the Presidency as a prize to be won not a responsibility to be assumed. His comments about what he would do as President mostly come off as a man who is itching to use the power of the office to his personal advantage, such as when he told Judge Curiel \"Wouldn\\'t it be wild if I come back [into your court] as the President\" or when he told an interviewer that he would appoint Supreme Court judges who would \"investigate Hillary\" (showing he understands the role of SCOTUS as little as he understands the role of POTUS).  When Democrats call Trump \"temperamentally unfit\" it is not JUST a cheap negative political attack, it is an accurate characterization of a man whose mind is unprepared, a man whose mouth is unfit, and frankly a man whose soul is unsound, to occupy the greatest position of responsibility in world history.  We are constantly told that Trump is \"pivoting\" or that his latest flap was just a \"mistake\" or a \"joke.\" **We are on the verge of electing a man so out of control that his children are said to have taken away his ability to Tweet.**  Hillary\\'s speech pattern - constant use of passive voice, deflection of accountability, and lawyerly evasions - is vastly less preferable than Obama\\'s. But I DO get the sense from her that she understands the Presidency is a position of responsibility. The bar is very, very low this year.   If Trump loses he will clearly attempt to delegitimize the next President with conspiracy theories (as he tried with Obama) which may cause civic unrest or even violence. If Trump wins, the prospect for a Constitutional crisis is even worse. So either way, just having Trump on the ballot has already caused damage to our democracy. This is a man who is singularly unconscious of the damaging role he is playing in American history.',\n",

       "  '&gt; There is an endless supply of people with ideas looking for people with money.  You have touched on the central problem.  ##The problem is Americans think being **rich** means you must be **successful** and being successful means you must be **competent**.  In reality there is no necessary connection here. You can be rich without being successful, it\\'s called an inheritance.   But more problematically, you can be successful without being competent, because under capitalism, capital works on behalf of the capitalists. On a large project, money effectively has the competence of whoever you hire with it. Trump could never build a building himself, but Trump\\'s money can.   It\\'s always argued that capital is \"taking a risk\" by investing (\"what if the capitalist hires the wrong people or invests in bad business ideas?\"), but what is that risk? We don\\'t have capital punishment for malinvestment! The only risk is that the **capital** itself would be destroyed, devolving the **capitalist** back down to the lower classes i.e. a normal human existence. But for a certain level of capital even this is not a real risk, as Trump\\'s multiple business bankruptcies and reorganizations shows.  In America we have a class system that\\'s really obvious, we just don\\'t talk about it. We have in general three lower classes and two upper classes (and no middle class).  1. **Hand to mouth slaves** - the people who are 2 paychecks away from having no shelter, no food and no possessions. Around half of Americans. Many of these people are actually negative net worth at any given moment in their lives and have no choice but to spend everything they earn.   2. **Rainy day slaves** - a barely superior class, these people are still living hand to mouth but have some emergency savings for a car crash etc.  3. **Lifers praying for the markets** - people who are earning enough that they are able to plan an adult life: a house, retirement, kids\\' education etc. Since nearly all their savings is devoted to future life expenses, these people are still not actually creating wealth by their saving, they are just deferring spending, thus they still belong to the lower class. One of the problems of the financial crash was that it prevented many millenials from graduating from rainy-day slaves to lifers. The money of lifers is thrown into \"the market\" where it\\'s managed impersonally by big funds. These savers have no choice but to pray that the market will be \"up\" when their big need arrives.   4. **Lower capital, the \"money managers\"** - the first class of idlers. You attain this class when you have a pile of money so large that you can live off the return it generates by \"working for you\" thus your job becomes managing this pile of money. This is the first class for whom money acts as actual *capital* instead of just corporate scrip (the two classes of slaves) or deferred spending (the lifers). The lower capital may be thrust back into the lower classes by truly heinous investment decisions or a depression.  5. **Higher capital, the idle wealthy** - when you have so much money, you, your family, *and a retinue of money managers* can live off the return. You\\'re so rich even managing your wealth becomes, quite affordably, someone else\\'s problem. Almost nothing can destroy higher capital except multiple generations of deliberate profligacy.  The problem with Trump is we have a lot of slaves looking at a man of higher capital and thinking, \"Wow, think of how much he saved and wisely invested to get to that point!\" That\\'s not how capital works. **Capital works ON BEHALF of the capitalists who delegate it.** ',\n",

       "  'I think you raise thought provoking points but I\\'m going to resist your new definitions a little partly as a devil\\'s advocate and partly because in this country we already define class way too attitudinally.  Effectively we have 2 delusions that we tell ourselves instead of actually addressing class. On the one hand, we pretend that there is no such thing as class, which we do by calling everyone under the sun \"the middle class.\" Something like 80% of Americans believe they are in the middle class, even though most of those 80% are at best what mainstream economists would call working class. The second delusion we use to deflect class discussions is to define class as a matter of culture, behavior and profession, hence we use terms like \"blue collar\" vs \"white collar\" or renting vs homeownership.   My definitions may be equally flawed along some other dimension, but the main point I\\'m making is that there\\'s a distinction between people who spend all or nearly all that they earn (for these people, money is effectively scrip), people who are able to save or invest for large predictable expenses (for these people, money is deferred spending), and people who live off their money working for them (this is capital as classically defined). I think the natural reaction of people in the first two groups, especially the second, is to try to redefine class to make themselves feel better off than they are (\"I may be living hand to mouth and renting but at least I\\'m white collar and have a degree!\"). I think a little of that is apparent in your last paragraph (I hope I can say that without feeling too aggressive?) Having amazing \"human capital\" is not the highest form of existence in capitalist society - having capital is.  \"Human capital\" is like the old joke about \"alternative medicine\" - \"if it worked, they\\'d call it medicine.\"',\n",

The four main deterrents against a Eurasian aggressor into Europe are:  1. US missile siting / nuclear umbrella 2. [US nuclear sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_sharing) 3. [US forward deployed bases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_deployments#Europe) 4. Article 5 of NATO / US Commitment to redeploy to Europe in case of war  Let\\'s be fuckin real: ~~Man With Half A Potato~~ Latvia may spend its dutiful 2% of GDP on defense but the Baltics\\' existence in NATO is (pick your favored theory) either A) as a buffer state whose mission is to slow the Russian tanks to buy time for USA\\'s redeployment / mobilization plan to make Germany defensible, or B) an aggressive, Kissingerian attempt to pressure the Russian state into balkanization by overloading its defense needs. The important point is that in either scenario, **the actual strategic value of Latvia** is its geographic position vis a vis the Russian state, NOT ITS DEFENSE BUDGET. The same goes for many other NATO states, such as Iceland and Turkey. The actual strategic value of Iceland is the [GIUK Gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIUK_gap) which enables the US to track and kill Russian subs if they try to enter the Atlantic. What\\'s the value of that compared to how far Iceland is falling short of the 2% goal? Well, since Iceland spends just 0.1% of its GDP on defense, the shortfall is 1.9% of Iceland\\'s GDP. That\\'s not very impressive: 315 million dollars, or **five hundredths of a percent** of the Pentagon\\'s annual budget. The in-kind value of having anti-sub warfare capabilities based in Iceland dwarf that figure, considering that a single current generation Russian sub costs on the order of a billion dollars.  Now you might accuse me of choosing an easy to defend example since Iceland has tremendous (yuge) geographic value and is a small economy. What about those freeloading Frenchies and other West Europeans who make up **\"Not-So-Secret Real NATO\"**^1 and benefit from a security umbrella while not living up to that 2% commitment? But the same logic of in-kind contributions still applies. Two of the most important of the Not So Secret Real NATO states, UK and France, provide immense diplomatic/strategic value for the US just by having their own sovereign nuclear arsenals sited in WEU. The dollar value of maintaining these arsenals is totally incommensurate with their military value. So why are we talking money again?  It\\'s important to be clear about this shit. Don\\'t accept Trump\\'s premise that we\\'re getting screwed if the allies don\\'t pay 2%. The fact is the USA gets a fantastic geostrategic bargain if the allies pay **0%**.  Seeing things in this light is important for another reason. It underlines the most significant fact about this debate.   ####Trump is *not* undermining NATO because he\\'s a \"greedy CEO\" who doesn\\'t understand geopolitics. He\\'s undermining it because he\\'s a traitor to the Western world order.  -------  Footnotes  1. \"Not So Secret Real NATO\" meaning the original founding states plus Germany - the states that NATO is actually intended to defend.

       "  'There\\'s an excellent POLITICO article about this:  [**The \"Grownups\" Won\\'t Save Us From Donald Trump**](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/05/16/trump-intel-confidential-russia-215142)  excerpt -   &gt; Consider the most likely explanation for what happened at that meeting. The president did not have a clue that he was revealing highly classified information provided by an ally. Why not? Because, according to information from endless anonymous sources, Trump has no patience for detailed intelligence briefings and wants information boiled down to bullet points, preferably with pictures or graphics. He has no sense of what’s classified and what’s not. Information goes “in one ear and out the mouth,” as one exasperated official put it to Reuters. boasting is just what Trump does, whether it’s a sensitive piece of intelligence or descriptions of his buildings, his golf clubs and the size of his electoral victory.  &gt; So what are the “grownups” supposed to do? In his briefing today, General McMaster kept insisting that whatever the president shared with the Russians was “wholly appropriate.” Putting aside the pesky question of whether that sharing jeopardized U.S. relations with the unnamed ally who provided hard-won intelligence, what was McMaster and the other top aides supposed to do if they felt that sharing wasn’t appropriate? Interrupt the president and change the subject? Wrestle him to the ground? Begin singing “Hail to the Chief” loudly enough to drown out what Trump was saying?  The President is out of control, because statutorily nobody else can control or restrain him, because the Founders had a presumption that *we wouldn\\'t fuck up as badly as we just fucked up.*  BTW how fucking pathetic is it that the President accidentally blurting classified info to a geopolitical adversary is already old news superseded by even crazier shit.',\n",

That\\'s \"evergreen money\" because it keeps growing itself. By contrast if you raise the same $2,700 amount from one person, that person is now dead to you because they\\'re maxed out. That\\'s \"deadwood money.\" Over 80% of Jeb\\'s total campaign fundraising was deadwood money by the winter of 2015.

But Super PACs can\\'t do private polling for the candidate. They can\\'t hold fundraising events or campaign events featuring the candidate (without breaking the law, the way Fiorina did). The only thing they can really do is run a parallel, money-unlimited campaign devoted to running TV ads. So huge amounts of money pouring into a single aspect of the campaign with diminishing returns and, over the course of the 2000s-2010s, increasing irrelevance.   If you look at Fiorina, Jeb, even to an extent Rubio, you see a campaign that was able to achieve air superiority and bomb Trump from the air but it didn\\'t matter because their ground game was weak. And that\\'s because contributing to a campaign also encourages buy-in and volunteerism. The dirty secret of election campaigns is that they are largely volunteer organizations, with the \"paid staff\" existing to muster &amp; organize pyramidal structures of volunteers. That is where Obama\\'s \"ground game\" came from. He had good political staff organizing early, but he also used online fundraising and Facebook groups like no candidate before (except Howard Dean) to create **an ARMY of people knocking on doors and registering voters.** This is where Bernie was weak in \\'16. \"Phonebanking\" is meaningless bullshit.

The truth is that **too often voters treat the Presidency like Miss World or The Voice.** You vote for who you like, because they\\'re from your region of the country or they sing the style of music you like. When they win, it\\'s like you &amp; your particular subculture get to win too. Voting for a country music star is a victory for country music and country music fans, while letting you stick your thumb in the eye of rap fans or rock fans. And you\\'re voting for the winner of American Idol to get rewarded with the contract and record deal, but you know that the details of that contract are really in the hands of Simon Cowell and the show\\'s producers.  When in reality the presidency is not like a talent show at all. It\\'s not a prize to be won, it\\'s a position of enormous responsibility. It\\'s not a contract or a gig, it\\'s an office of executive authority that is almost completely unaccountable to anyone else. It can\\'t be gainsaid by any other power in the entire country except the narrow checks and balances imposed on it by Congress &amp; the judiciary according to the Constitution.   People don\\'t really understand how our 3 branches system works.   An example is that video from **Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez** that went viral last month, in which she deplored that **there isn\\'t a law to keep Senators who received donations from Industry XYZ from writing bills about that industry**, and strongly implied that this should change.   Another example is when people say that \"we need to write laws after Trump to make everything he\\'s doing illegal.\"   This is not how it works.  You can\\'t write a law that restricts one or more Senators from writing laws about particular subjects. And you can\\'t write a law that keeps Trump from appointing openly pay-to-play politicians like DeVos to dismantle their own cabinet departments.   If such laws were passed they would IMMEDIATELY, and rightly, be struck down by the Supreme Court as unConstitutional.   The way our system of government actually works is that the three branches are coequal and supreme, subject to the Constitution only. [The Congress can\\'t even write a law that binds &amp; commits a future Congress to action or inaction, for example to spend or not spend certain money.](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2010/07/can-today-s-congress-tell-tomorrow-s-congress-what-to-do-no-maybe-sort-of.html)  We have a representative form of government, in which ***the people delegate authority to the legislature and executive for the period in which they hold office.***  That means you don\\'t get to elect a Senator and then go \"But he can\\'t write laws about the oil industry because I know they donated to him.\" You imbued that Senator with legislative authority by voting for them. AOC may not want climate-denier Senator Jim Inhofe writing up an anti-New-Green-Deal bill but there is absolutely nothing she can do to take his legislative authority away or shrink its ambit.   That means that when you vote for a President, or Senator or even Representative, you are voting for someone to have almost supreme and unaccountable authority. **THERE IS NO REF in American politics.** Even the judiciary is subject to Presidential appointment and Congressional confirmation, which means if you elect a bad enough President, the entire definition of what is Constitutional could at least nominally change.   The lesson of 2016 is not just \"Trump is a bad person,\" it\\'s that you SHOULD COMPLETELY FUCKING IGNORE all personality-based politics, and indeed put aside partisan and issue-based politics, and vote first and foremost for the person who is actually responsible enough to be entrusted with the Presidency and its mind-bogglingly enormous powers, **even if you don\\'t like or trust them, even if they are on the \"wrong\" side of the issues. It is your DUTY as an American to vote for the party you hate if it\\'s the only party that nominates a responsible candidate.**  It is only the view of the Presidency as a sort of reality-TV prize that let Trump get within a mile of being elected in the first place.

You can see the dynamic in Biden's numbers as well. Each of those eight YouGov polls had Biden at 26 or below whereas only a quarter of the 31 non-YouGov polls had Biden *even under 30*.

Again, we'll have to wait for the vote to see if YouGov's pollster rating will go up or down...  **On top of all of this uncertainty, the Ann Selzer poll is a big f#cking deal.** She has a stellar track record of polling Iowa (similar to the Field Poll in California, for people who have heard of that one). If she shows Buttigieg not only with a chance to place in the Iowa top 3, not only with a chance to pass BOTH Bernie and Warren and lay claim to the progressive lane opposing Biden in the media cycle after Iowa, but actually a chance *to win Iowa outright and defeat Biden*, that is a 120 decibel wakeup call to the Warren and Sanders campaigns. You can argue that Buttigieg has few nonWhite supporters but if he starts out with two elections in a row where he does better than Sanders or Warren or BOTH, that is not good news for them. Voters in future states might start seeing Buttigieg as their main chance to stop Biden.\",\n",

The value of NOT being in the education system, and having to be an independent adult, is underrated by college advocates.  - Second, you\\'re rapidly accelerating the demise of college degrees. When everyone has an extra 2 years of \"accredited\" education, it will cease to mean anything at all, just like High School diplomas currently are meaningless to all but the absolute bottom of the barrel employers  - Third, obviously when you put EVERYONE through the same education system then it only teaches the lowest common denominator; there\\'s no reason to believe that these 100% admission community colleges will end up being any more academically rigorous than the state colleges that are currently on the \"Best Party Colleges\" lists  - The biggest problem is that *you can\\'t fix the education system at the end of the pipeline*. The problem we have with education is that we\\'re forcibly \"Graduating\" people out of high school who are barely literate; even worse with math; and lack a foundation in civics, history &amp; science. You can\\'t \"fix\" these people by giving them 2 years of free college that they\\'re not prepared to handle, or affirmative-action admission to top colleges where they\\'ll fail out or hold back other students.

The ENTIRE reason for the focus on college is because by the time people are old enough to vote, they care more about their college prospects (or debt from college) than actually fixing our education system where it matters.

Meanwhile places like Starbucks project a moderate or liberal corporate image but mistreat their workers horribly thanks to overwhelming pressure from Wall Street to produce results.   For example Starbucks used to schedule \"clopens\" which is when a worker finds themselves assigned to the closing shift on one day and the opening shift on the next. Since Starbucks closes super late and opens before dawn, in extreme cases workers had as little as **5 hours** between two full length shifts. Good luck fitting a commute home, shower, sleep, waking &amp; breakfast, and commute back to the store in 5 hours!   Starbucks only addressed this policy when [the New York Times did an extensive expose](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/13/us/starbucks-workers-scheduling-hours.html). They tried to blame it on \"computer errors\" but the reality is that Starbucks views labor as disposable units and you\\'d be lucky to receive consistent or humane scheduling. Clopens began after the recession when Starbucks found themselves vastly over-extended and needed to \"reduce operational costs\" to recover profitability. The answer was a computer program that fits all the \"I gave 40 hrs a week availability\" workers into a Tetris puzzle that makes sure nobody *actually* gets more than 20. That would mean benefits!  Of course, at all these McJobs, it should go without saying that they make you watch an anti-union video as part of \"training.\" Usually it comes right before the ukelele-filled short film about how amazing their corporate culture is and how happy they are that you\\'ve chosen to become a \"partner.\"  Donating to Republicans is really shitty, but **the impact on society &amp; politics that these corporations exert through labor management** is far more significant than the impact they exert through campaign donations. True liberals should be talking about wages, hours, benefits, and worker protections, not whether a corporate CEO prefers to go on Tucker Carlson or Stephen Colbert, or whether they donate a few 10k\\'s to Planned Parenthood or Prop 8.  Sometimes I feel like Democrats have totally lost touch with the concerns of the actual working class they\\'re supposed to represent. I guarantee you Democrats can win more working class &amp; working poor votes by talking about the issues in their real lives not which party a CEO donates to.

To briefly explain, in [South Carolina](https://www.washingtonpost.com./graphics/politics/exit-polls-2020-south-carolina-primary/) for instance, voters 30-44 were 18% of voters, Joe won 33% of them, and there were [538,259](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Results_of_the_2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries#Early_states) votes in South Carolina.

On the other hand, the fact that the book is out right now and she only dropped three tapes, plus the [massive \"explosiveness gap\" between the relatively mundane stuff she has actually proven on tape versus the other bizarre but amazing-if-true claims she\\'s made](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/97cpyl/omarosa_devos_said_black_college_students_lack/e483zpv/?context=3), points to the Pierson/Patton tape being the \"worst\" she has in her arsenal.

Absent a tape, I don\\'t believe a word that comes out of her mouth even if it\\'s something I\\'d love to believe.  I could easily see her having nothing more to drop, and therefore never dropping another tape again and playing a coy \"Did I get paid off? We\\'ll never know! Buy my book!\" game with the media. I could see her dropping another meh tape or two until the media catches on that she blew her load with the Pierson tape. And finally, I could see her dropping tapes that are even worse than the Pierson tape and backing up some of the so-far unproven claims from her book/media tour. Any one of those seems possible.

AOC is net unpopular in New York state, much less in the nation. There\\'s a reason Trump leaped on the opportunity to make \"the Squad\" the face of the Democratic Party by forcing Pelosi to defend them from his racist attacks. That was a net win for Trump electorally.  AOC could live to be 200 and yet never face a meaningful challenge for her Bronx congressional district. It\\'s solid blue until the end of time. Meanwhile Obama is the most successful Democratic politician of our lifetime at winning NATIONAL elections. I dunno what it is about most Redditors suddenly thinking Obama is either a paid corrupt corporatist shill or he doesn\\'t know how to win elections. Obama didn\\'t even attack Saint Bernie. He just said Democrats should be focused on promising what is deliverable. Anyone who can count to 100 can figure out M4A is NOT going to happen in the next US Senate. Not Bernie\\'s plan, not Warren\\'s. Pointing this out is no more and no less than pointing out the facts. It\\'s not a \"Republican talking point.\" It\\'s not \"the politics of No You Can\\'t.\" It\\'s not \"diminishing Democratic energy and splitting the base.\" It\\'s the politics of reality. If Obama is going to be all alone this year in pointing that out, you can count me as an Obamacrat.  I hate it when people say that those of us who are pointing out the facts are \"opponents\" of Medicare 4 All. I\\'m not an opponent of single payer healthcare (no matter what dumb slogan Bernie renames it as). I WANT single payer healthcare. I just recognize that if you want single payer healthcare you better figure out how to get the following:  - **2 Democratic senators in Montana** - **2 Democratic senators in North Dakota** - **2 Democratic senators in West Virginia** - **2 Democratic senators in Arkansas** - **2 Democratic senators in Virginia** - **2 Democratic senators in Colorado** - **2 Democratic senators in New Mexico** - **1 Democratic senator from South Dakota** - **another from Nebraska** - **and Alaska** - **and North Carolina** - **and Missouri** - **and Indiana** - **and Lousiana** - **and Florida** - **and Iowa** - **and Nevada**  holy shit, right?

Here is what Benjamin Franklin had to say about a certain group of immigrants:  &gt; ####\"Those who come hither are generally of the most ignorant Stupid Sort of their own Nation…and as few of [us] understand [their] Language, and so cannot address them either from the Press or Pulpit, ’tis almost impossible to remove any prejudices they once entertain…Not being used to Liberty, they know not how to make a modest use of it… they come [to vote] in droves, and carry all before them, except in one or two Counties...In short unless the stream of their importation could be turned from this to other colonies, as you very judiciously propose, they will soon so out number us, that all the advantages we have will not in My Opinion be able to preserve our language, and even our Government will become precarious.\"  Guess who he was talking about? Germans.   But wait, aren\\'t Germans white? Not if you ask Benjamin Franklin:  &gt; #### Why should Pennsylvania, founded by the   English, become a Colony of Aliens, who will shortly be so numerous as to Germanize us instead of our Anglifying them, and will never adopt our   Language or Customs, **any more than they can acquire our Complexion.** Which leads me to add one Remark: That the Number of purely white People in the World is proportionably very small... In Europe, the Spaniards, Italians, French, Russians and Swedes, are generally of what we call a swarthy Complexion; as are the Germans also, **the Saxons only excepted, who with the English, make the principal Body of White People** on the Face of the Earth. I could wish their Numbers were increased.  [more context for these quotes is available in this excellent AskHistorians post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6batyz/why_would_ben_franklin_call_germans_and_swedes/)  Even Germans and Irish were not considered \"proper\" Whites by people in the 18th century. Some of our forefathers were racist as fuck. I think plenty of them would have no problem with Trumpism.  ####We have to stop looking to the past for models. In fact by doing so you are buying into the same rhetorical frame that \"MAGA\" occupies. The past was better and full of heroes, we must return to it or imitate it.  This reminds me of when people say \"Jesus would have no problem with gay marriage.\" No dude, Jesus was a first century heterodox Jew. If he had ever said anything in favor of homosexual relationships it would have been written down just like all of his other contentions with the Pharisees.   Or when people hold up a sign that says \"here\\'s what Jesus said about gay marriage\" and the rest is blank. Clever, but the criterion of silence makes it likely that Jesus was orthodox except in those principles which his disciples memorialized as \"arguments\" with Pharasic Jews.   Instead of *pretending* that Jesus would be okay with it, or inventing an ahistorical version of Jesus, why don\\'t we just say the truth, which is that Jesus was wrong and you don\\'t need to cite Jesus to prove something is right?   Ultimately, progress depends on rejecting tradition. If tradition was right all the time there\\'d be no reason to reform or progress society.   Thus, if you\\'re a progressive, be careful of how much you buy into the frame of the heroic past. You don\\'t need to *constantly* be reminding people that Thomas Jefferson was a rapist and Christopher Columbus was a murderer, but it\\'s also not that productive to put up \"The Founders\" as this sort of democratic Anubis that weighs Trump\\'s merit against a feather. The people who should be judging Trump are we, the Americans who have to deal with him. And in our opinion, he fucking stinks.',\n",

Remember all those Republicans saying **\"of course firing Comey wasn\\'t obstruction, because the President couldn\\'t possibly (be stupid enough to) believe that firing Comey would terminate the investigation.\"**  This story KILLS that narrative.  Trump fired Comey and then, when it didn\\'t shut down the investigation, almost immediately tried to fire his successor.  What do I mean by almost immediately? I mean  #almost fucking immediately.  How do I know? Let\\'s look at:  # (the worst, believe me) TIMELINE of Events Between Comey Firing And Mueller \"Firing\"  ####(credit to Bill Moyers, NPR, WaPo and NYT for original research. Go be a patriot, buy a newspaper.)  - May 6-7 - Trump at Bedminster. According to Wolff, convinced by Kushner to fire Comey.  - May 8 - Trump meets Rosenstein + Sessions, Rosenstein begins drafting Comey excuse letter. Also May 8 - Yates testifies to Congress.  - **May 9 - Comey fired.** \"The Long Fortnight\" begins.  - May 10 - Trump-Russians meeting at WH (\"Comey\\'s a nutjob, pressure\\'s off now.\") Rosenstein phones McGahn and demands WH corrects public impression that Rosenstein initiated Comey firing.  - May 11 - Trump interviewed by Lester Holt to bat down growing public reaction to firing, but contradicts the excuse memo, calls out \"made up Russia investigation\" as a reason for firing, and says he would have fired without Rosenstein memo.  - May 12 - Trump subtweets Comey with \"Better hope there aren\\'t tapes\"  - May 16 - Comey reveals existence of contemporaneous memos about Trump\\'s line-crossing behavior. Mueller interviewed for FBI chief.  - **May 17 - Rosenstein appoints Mueller without warning, blindsiding White House**  - May 19 - Senate says Comey will testify publicly  - May 22 - Flynn pleads 5th to Senate Intel   - May 26 - First reporting of Kushner-Kislyak \"back channel\" attempt  - May 27 - additional reporting reveals other, not-disclosed Kush-Kis meetings  - May 31 - Flynn and Cohen receive subpoenas. Nunes issues dueling \"unmasking\" related subpoenas.  - **June 2 - Mueller assumes control of Comey investigation resources. i.e. \"day one\" of Mueller on his new job.**  - June 7 + 8 - Comey releases account of contemporaneous memo &amp; testifies to Congress about it. Trump tweets \"vindication\" and calls Comey \"a leaker.\"  - June 9 thru 11 - **Trump is at NY resort, golfing over weekend. Did McGahn accompany him?** Otherwise we can possibly eliminate these days.  - [**June 12 - RUMORS SWIRL IN MEDIA ABOUT TRUMP \"CONSIDERING\" FIRING MUELLER. One source was Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy, one of Trump\\'s dial-up confidants. These rumors now look like the aftermath of a real firing attempt.**](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-confidant-think-hes-considering-perhaps-terminating-special-counsel)  - June 13 - [TRUMP LAUNCHES TWITTER ATTACK ON FORMER AG LYNCH](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2017-06-13/donald-trump-launches-twitter-attack-against-former-attorney-general-loretta-lynch) tweeting that she \"made law enforcement decisions for political purposes... gave Hillary Clinton a free pass and protection\". Rosenstein says publicly no reason to fire Mueller. **Reading between lines - Trump lashing out here at Sessions/Rosenstein for not being \"protectors\" - did Trump also experience pushback from them? Could be more to this attempted-firing story than McGahn...** In either case, this tweet is also something to re-evaluate in the light of new media reports. By the way, around this time Sarah Huckabee Sanders holds a presser denying that the President had even considered (much less attempted) to fire Mueller - so, you know, one more gold star for her in everyone\\'s credibility book right?  - June 15 - Mueller begins requesting interviews with senior WH staff. Media speculates an OOJ investigation, Trump tweets **\"the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history, led by some very bad and conflicted people!\"** The witch-hunt tweet makes waves, if I recall accurately, because it was Trump\\'s first public comment on Mueller.  - June 23 - POLITICO publishes a [\"Trump loses patience with McGahn\"](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/23/trump-don-mcgahn-white-house-counsel-russia-239876) headline, recounting a meeting \"at the beginning of the week\" (that would presumably be the 19th): **Trump started the week by giving McGahn a dressing down in the Oval Office for not doing more to quash the Russia probe early on.** Another news story that looks interestingly different in hindsight.   ------  So.... Using the news archives, I think we can narrow this new Trump-tried-to-fire-Mueller story down to a relatively narrow window in June - **later than June 2 and no later than June 11.** It looks like both the Ruddy interview and the Loretta Lynch tweet are taking place in the \"Aftermath\" of Trump\\'s failed beta-boss showdown with McGahn, and the June 15 \"Witch Hunt\" tweet is his attempt to take control politically since just ordering his firing has failed.  In other words... if Trump tried to fire Mueller between June 2 and June 11,   #**Trump tried to fire Mueller in his first or second week on the job.**  # This is consciousness of guilt. Mueller didn\\'t do a damn thing in between taking over the investigations and being almost fired. Mueller had to be fired for the same reason Comey had to be fired: Trump knows he is guilty.',\n",

For one example, Reddit was celebrating over both Weisselberg and Pecker \"flipping\" due to being \"given immunity.\" But their immunity was only in exchange for testifying before the grand jury about the pornstar payments. It wasn\\'t a cooperation agreement to show where every single body is buried. But people acted like Trump was totally done because a senior official of ~~the Mob~~ TrumpCo had \"flipped.\" Another example was Papadop-dude. When he put out his cooperation agreement people assumed he\\'d been wearing a wire for weeks or months, had all kinds of dirt on Clovis and Sessions and would even directly incriminate Trump. So far his most thunderous contribution to the investigation is saying that Trump nodded about a meeting with Putin, which just confirms reporting from the last 2 years leading up to Helsinki that Trump has *repeatedly* sought a private meeting with Putin over his WH aides\\' objections.  Accepting written answers from Trump can\\'t be interpreted as anything other than a defeat, or setback, for the special counsel.   - Trump gets to consult his lawyers,  - make up the most legally tenable lie,  - is safe from followup questions,  - and if the SC shows that some of the answers are lies then Trump will just throw a lawyer under the bus and say \"he wrote it!\"  Mueller is obviously better at strategy and tactics than the Trump team but stop assuming he\\'s got this in the bag.   ####What I see about Mueller unfortunately reminds me very much of Patrick Fitzgerald.   He was a special counsel appointed to figure out who blew a CIA agent\\'s identity because her husband, an ambassador to Africa, told the public that part of Bush\\'s case for the Iraq War was a lie. In the minds of Bush opponents (like me) at the time, there was going to be this thing called **Fitzmas** - Fitz was going to prove that Dick Cheney or Donald Rumsfeld had leaked the information and senior WH staff were going to be led off in handcuffs and proceed to bring down the entire administration. Well what actually happened is the WH stonewalled the investigation entirely and all Fitz could do was indict one of Cheney\\'s aides for obstruction of justice and perjury. Fitzmas was a fizzle. Then Bush promptly commuted that aide\\'s sentence, and the next Republican President pardoned him entirely.  That\\'s what I see going on here. A lot of junior aides are in deep shit for obvious obstruction, perjury and MFS. Separately from that, a lot of guys who surround Trump are criminals (Manafort, Cohen) and are getting all their shit uncovered as a side effect of the investigation. But so far as \"Mueller knows what Trump ate for breakfast,\" I see no evidence of him getting that close.   He would have a lot stronger hand with a Democratic Congress. Fuck it, he\\'d have a lot stronger hand if half of America were in the streets tomorrow.

You can probably find videos of it on youtube (edit: [here\\'s a video of him claiming Obama would \"lose 49 states\" if nominated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVHq-SLrah4)). If I recall correctly, was forced to resign &amp; dissociate himself from HRC\\'s campaign when it came out that he was accepting $millions to lobby for African dictators. (EDIT: I was wrong, I confused him with Clinton\\'s \\'08 campaign manager Mark Penn). The reason I remember old Lanny so clearly is because the Clinton campaign\\'s attacks on Obama\\'s candidacy were relentless, unfair, even [racially tinged](https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/08/clinton-touts-white-support/) on more than one occasion. And Lanny was front &amp; center in that effort.  (If you\\'re a Bernie supporter and think your candidate was attacked unfairly you don\\'t have a fucking clue, compared to 2008 Clinton treated her 2016 opponent with complete kid gloves because he wasn\\'t a threat to win at all and because she was terrified of alienating younger/left voters).  The fact that he\\'s now representing Cohen is bizarre, and probably a portent of the poor legal representation that Trump officials are able to get.

If you check out a lot of 2008 Hillary campaign alumni you\\'ll find out that they\\'ve sort of floated into centrist/swampy careers. For example Mark Penn, the guy who famously lost Hillary the primary by not looking up whether California\\'s delegate system was winner-take-all, is now an opinion columnist for FOX News throwing FUD on the Mueller investigation.  I would have to rank anything this Davis character says as maybe a 9 out of 11 on the Giuvenatti Scale: Believe it when there\\'s confirmation from other sources. These lawyers love to go on talk shows while we\\'re still waiting for actual evidence to be presented.  EDIT: My other thought on this is, after some consideration of what Lanny Davis\\'s weird involvement might mean, is that of course I don\\'t believe stupid Podesta conspiracy theories, but there quite possibly are \"Democratic Manaforts\" out there, that is people who have made a living by representing (sometimes without proper disclosure) unsavory or unpopular figures in their Washington lobbying efforts. This Mueller thing has so far been targeted very narrowly but it could expand and even hop over party lines very quickly. The investigators are following money trails and there\\'s nothing to say that some unsavory figures haven\\'t been buying favors on both sides. It seems to me that if Cohen and Trump end up having adversarial legal interests, or Trump and Manafort etc., there might be some well connected Democrats interested in taking Cohen\\'s side or Manafort\\'s side both for the purposes of taking down Trump and for the purposes of containing the counterintelligence/corruption aspects of the investigation. That\\'s just a suspicion.',\n",

       "  '&gt; Wow. Maybe Helsinki really did grease the wheels.  ####The intelligence community has **already known everything there is to know**, for about 2 years.   Over a year ago I theorized the existence of [**Mr. Good Shit**](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6bt4pu/report_trump_knew_flynn_was_under_investigation/dhpc9hc/), who is basically the Deep Throat of Russiagate. [edit: to anyone who says this \"sounds like Q\", actually my post predates that garbage by a year, and actually has evidence. Q is *literally some assclown LARPing as Deep Throat*, as in they\\'re entirely inspired by the Nixon affair, so it makes sense that an *actual* Deep Throat situation would \"seem similar to Q\". Don\\'t put the cart before the horse.].  Mr Good Shit was just a way of sorting through the enormous number of leaks and revelations coming out of the administration. I pointed out that when you stripped away the petty leaking that obviously came from turf-warring WH aides (\"Trump doesn\\'t read briefings!\") and which often leaked to a bevy of sources from CNN to the Atlantic to Buzzfeed to the NY Post, what was left was a set of leaks with consistent timing (F5oclock), consistent delivery (almost always sent to WaPo or NYT), and a focus on the Flynn affair. A great example of Mr. Good Shit\\'s devastating timing &amp; accuracy is when Paul Ryan started making noises about being a Comey \"skeptic.\" Then boom, [Mr. Good Shit dropped the \"Nobody talks, that\\'s how we know we\\'re a family\" tape on him](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6bt4pu/report_trump_knew_flynn_was_under_investigation/dhpc9hc/) and Ryan was effectively taken out of the equation.  The ability to drop tactical bangers like that implies a source that has a *catalog* of things to drop and is playing with media and narrative to make sure their material has maximum impact. In other words, a source who already knows the entire Trump-Russia story. In other words, the alphabet agencies.  They\\'ve just been slow walking us through the revelations for three good reasons:  1. They want USA to get rid of Trump \"by the book.\" They don\\'t want to turn us into Turkey where the army or the intelligence services become considered a check on the President.  2. They want the revelations to have maximum impact. They\\'re *teaching* the public the entire story of what happened, piece by piece, pacing it for news media saturation. If they just dropped everything, it would put the public into catatonic shock. The entire news media spent weeks just digesting the existence of a meeting between Trump Jr and a Russian agent.  3. They have followed a consistent strategy of leaking just enough to a reporter to establish a story. The reporter then gets the WH on the record denying, and then Mr. Good Shit drops the other shoe with proof of what happened. This happened to the Trump team about 5 times in their account of the Trump Tower meeting. SHS\\'s recent refusal to go on the record denying an N-Word tape is perhaps a sign that the WH is learning that *somewhere out there, someone has everything.*  If you look at the course of the Russia investigation starting from its proper beginning in mid 2016, there have been two periods where things \"accelerated.\"  The first period was in the fortnight between Comey getting fired and Mueller starting as SC. The intelligence community leaked like crazy and we learned a ton during that period. It was basically them trying to force Congress/DOJ\\'s hand.   The second period has been post Helsinki. I think Helsinki really changed the script for how Mr. Good Shit sees this turning out. Except any further Trump-Putin meetings to be headed off by massive revelations.',\n",

       "  '&gt;I never knew it was possible to hate this much.  #I had the best Trump idea ever today thanks to Wikipedia.  So check it out, in medieval times the ruler of Venice was called a Doge (Italian for Duke) and because the Venetians were proud of their centuries-old democracy they had a hall with paintings of all the Doges.  Except one Doge was a real asshole and tried to break the democracy streak by making himself dictator. The Venetians were so pissed they cut off his head. Then because they were still pissed they knocked down the house where he was born and made a law against saying his name. Finally they were so pissed they took his portrait down from the Hall of Doges and hired a painter to paint A BLACK SQUARE with the most expensive paint they could find. And put that up as his new portrait. They were so angry at this shitfucking Doge that they invented abstract art just to get back at him.  Now that gave me the best idea ever. How about when this is all over - the impeachment and all...   I want it so that in every textbook...  ...on every website...  ...from the animatronics at Disney World to the portrait gallery of the White House...  Donald J Trump will go down in history as a simple black square with the words TOTAL FUCKFACE on it.  No name, no image, no video, no sound, no historical record at all except a black square inscribed with TOTAL FUCKFACE, will pass down in history.  I want future schoolchildren to learn the order of the Presidents and between Barack Obama and Elon Musk they all gleefully yell \"TOTAL FUCKFACE.\"  I want bank robbers to go shopping for Halloween masks and there\\'s one missing.  I want that skyscraper in Manhattan to become a museum of democracy, with giant gold letters down the side spelling TOTAL FUCKFACE.  I want it so that historians debate what the TOTAL FUCKFACE looked like.  I want there to be tall tales seven centuries from now that the TOTAL FUCKFACE had hair like blow-dried pubes the color of a smoker\\'s teeth  and his mouth was like a desiccated pharaoh\\'s anus  and he filled a suit like caramel pudding fills a garbage bag on a hot sidewalk  and his favorite thing in the world was to be peed on.  And I want future historians to go on three dimensional Ken Burns hyperdocumentaries and say that this is obviously a myth and people have been making these stories crazier for centuries like Paul Bunyan or Baba Yaga  and the TOTAL FUCKFACE probably was a normal looking human after all with adult sized hands  and it\\'s not true that he tried to turn his country club into a second White House so he could golf more  or that one time he told a war widow \"Your husband knew what he signed up for\"  or that he barfed so prodigiously on the Senate Majority Leader during the impeachment trial that it started the 21st-century slang \"a wicked schume\"  or that every man who had served in his White House found that their dicks never worked again just like the gypsy woman said  or that he forgot his own children\\'s names on live television at least twice  or that he sat on every chair like it was a toilet  or that he literally stole the Christmas of 2018 and nobody found it ever again  or that he bragged about committing sexual assault while knowingly wearing a microphone  or that one time he tried to give himself a medal for not being black  or that his advisers had to make sure his name was on every page of a briefing otherwise he wouldn\\'t read it  or that even before every single picture and video of the man had been destroyed people already could not remember if he had ever uttered a truly joyful laugh  or that one time he went to a pizza place to show he was a regular guy and he was given two slices on plates and he stacked the slices on one plate and scabbed the mozzarella off into a pile and ate the steam-sogged tomatobread that was left by slicing it into small pieces and putting it bite by bite into his mouth with a fork but because he was rich nobody arrested him  \"Although,\" the 27th-century historian will warn his 3DTV audience, \"Any one of these absurd tall tales could be true and we will never know thanks to the grimly determined and united efforts of 21st-Century Man.

       "  'That comic like most political comics is glib and misinformed. Solar and wind rely on rare earths which are... rare. Just as easy for oligopolists to control as any coal mine. Mining them is also very pollutive. China is the only major power that mines them in significant tonnage and they restrict exports which is the reason the iPhone and many other hi tech products are mfd in China. Also, solar and wind - especially rooftop solar - have **more deaths per TWh of electricity generated** than nuclear power and that\\'s *including* every nuclear disaster. Hydro is even worse than solar in that regard (the Banqiao disaster, which you\\'ve never heard of unlike Fukushima and Chernobyl, displaced **11 million** people and killed nearly 200,000). So if you\\'re looking for the safest option, that\\'s nuclear.  Another thing that never gets addressed in these Reddit threads about \"renewable\" energy is how bad the harmonicity of wind power is for electrical grids, not to mention a necessary increase in transmission losses as the technology\\'s scaled up, as right now wind and solar are only used in the most ideal locales. Nuclear will never have significant transmission losses because small modular plants can meet grid demand on state or even local levels. For wind and solar this is a physical impossibility. Not even Star Trek wireless energy beaming, powered by Reddit furiously masturbating to a picture of Elon Musk, will get rid of transmission loss. If you want plentiful, cheap, safe electrical power that won\\'t kill the climate, your choices are nuclear or Jill Stein\\'s magic beans.  One last thing. With nuclear, ee can desalinate seawater and split water molecules right in the plant. That means endless renewable drinking water and endless renewable zero carbon fuel for transportation. If this sounds like a scam look up the experiments they did in the fifties with thorium fuel cycles. Or look at the navy\\'s own current project to create zero carbon jet fuel so their carriers have a reason to exist in 2050.

It's kind of nuts to ask a blind trustee to manage however many billions of dollars his businesses are worth. Can anyone blame him for wanting his kids to manage his empire instead? At least they know his plans.  2. He would have to sell all his businesses after the election but before the inauguration, a very narrow window.  3. There would inevitably be allegations of corruption anyway as the people or corporations that buy Trump's businesses would be accused of doing so at inflated prices as a sneaky way of bribing an incoming President.  The fact is we've never had a President this rich and with this many operating businesses before. I'm starting to think that we never *should* have a President this rich. Even if the person we elect were acting in good faith, it's just impossible to manage the transition from business tycoon to president.

       "  'I wonder if I\\'ll be upvoted or downvoted for pointing this out, but Trump\\'s worldview isn\\'t really that unique. There has always been a strain of conservatism, called today \"paleoconservatism,\" that was isolationist and saw nearly all international alliances as a net drain on America\\'s interests. Often there is an element of parochial racism tangled up in this: \"Why should *we* die for *them*\" especially if the \"them\" is someone like Japan with a different race or even a different religion. Before Trump ever came along there was Ron Paul and before him **Pat Buchanan**, Ross Perot and others. Before Trump was ever a Republican or Democrat, he was involved with the **Reform Party** which was Pat Buchanan\\'s pet project.   You don\\'t need to hypothesize that Trump has been **suborned or bribed by Russia.** It would be more accurate to say that Trump has always held these opinions - as one can see from his political activities &amp; consistent anti-alliance statements stretching back decades - and Russia is opportunistically fostering this strain of conservatism, just like Russia has openly sponsored various political movements across Europe.  Trump is just one arrow in Russia\\'s quiver. They sponsor Jill Stein and the far left in the USA while sponsoring Le Pen and the far right in France. Wormtongue, Grishnakh, and Bill Ferny wouldn\\'t have got along but they were all three tools of Sauron.   Russia\\'s overall goal is to cause disunity, strife and maximum chaos, to use democracy against itself. One of the main weaknesses of democracy is that it is beyond the pale to accuse your opponent of being a fifth column or a useful idiot for a foreign power. The USA has a long tradition of eventually cracking down on those politicians who conspiratorially accuse their opponents of being the tools of our overseas adversaries and enemies. For that reason, Russia feels that it can interfere in American domestic politics **with impunity** because anyone who draws attention to it will reek of \"conspiratard\" or \"McCarthyist,\" which are indeed labels that Trump supporters have flung at their opponents.  So. Why Trump now? These voices have always been on the fringe of the Republican Party in our lifetimes because the GOP has been defined by a **fusionist conservatism** that brings together the three key elements of the modern Right under the banner of antiCommunism. AKA the **\"Reagan Coalition\"** or what some writers have called the \"Three Legged Stool\": big biz, the Christian Right, and foreign policy hawks.  While the 2012 GOP candidates competed in debates to see who could namecheck Reagan the most, it wasn\\'t hard to see that the winds were changing. In fact, overdue for a change.  - Communism hasn\\'t been a real threat for years, thus the main political motivation (fear) that drove the three GOP factions together was gone. Terrorism temporarily substituted for communism otherwise the GOP crackup might have come much sooner. - big business has been discredited by our rapidly increasing income inequality, a rapid corporate financialization/securitization of the economy that ended in the largest crash of our lifetimes, and neoliberal trade policies that have disproportionately hurt the same lower class white voters that the GOP uses as its electoral footsoldiers - hawkish internationalists were discredited by the disaster in Iraq - the Christian Right has failed to stop abortion, gay marriage, or any of its other bugbears - someone who was 25 and voted for Reagan in 1980 would be 61 today. The Reagan Voter is **mostly dead.** All of the right wing opinion leaders from that time period such as Peggy Noonan, Jerry Falwell, Phyllis Schlafly and so on, are either decrepit, dead or consigned to ignominy.  Just in general, the idea of Reagan Conservatism stopped meaning anything meaningful and positive to anybody but outright Christian Dominionists like Cruz and Palin, and taxcut maniacs like the staff of the National Review. Notice how those were the forces insisting on fealty to \"Reaganism\" during the recent Republican Primary, while Trump scarcely namechecked Reagan at all compared to his opponents.  The break with Reagan-Bushism, aka **The Great Conservative Crackup** has been in the offing for a long time. Many, many liberal commentators and observers predicted this. In fact, we have been predicting it since Hurricane Katrina and Jack Abramoff and Kitzmiller v. Dover and the Social Security privatization bust, all of which is ten to twelve years ago now. But we predicted that the GOP would move forward with \"reformaconservatism\": a reinvention of its policy focus and a host of young politicians taking a page from Obama\\'s branding team. Remember how bullish so many liberal writers were on Rubio winning the primary? We did not predict Trump and the toxic mix of paleo/alt conservatism he represents.',\n",

       "  'Good question.  The main important point in Russia-China relations is that China is an alternative market for Russian energy exports, which have *mainly* gone to Europe. In fact Europe relies on Russian gas to keep the heat on in the winter. Well, a few years ago the Russians tried a bit of a powerplay / economic blackmail against Ukraine (this was before the war). The pipelines to Europe run... through Ukraine. This convinced the EU that they could not count on Russia as a consistent supplier; put that together with the natural gas glut in the US and our determination to eventually become an energy exporter to Europe. Thus, China kind of has Russia over a barrel right now, and certainly does if the EU becomes energy independent (of Russia). Chinese economic expansion westward (\"Silk Road\" projects, cooperation with Central Asia, Pakistan and Africa) also is contesting one of Russia\\'s traditional backyards. China is booming demographically while Russia is in a long decline - and there\\'s a lot of empty land between Beijing and Moscow that is only nominally Russian. Like some European countries, the ethnicity at the center of the Russian state is in demographic decline *and* is having trouble integrating non-Russians into its political contract (this has always been an advantage of the USA versus all possible adversaries). The Chinese economy has problems and could enter recession within the next few years, but Russia\\'s economic picture is worse. China\\'s military is also increasingly ascendant not in the sense that they could fight USA toe to toe, but they could make a regional non-nuclear war long and difficult for the USA and use area denial weaponry to prevent us using our naval and air power as effectively as we would wish. Their strategy for fighting us is sort of the upscaling of a guerilla war - they use cheap sacrificial means to make us fear a costly sacrifice, except instead of losing lives it would be losing multi-billion-dollar carriers (and lives, duh). With Russia, while Putin has restored the military compared to the shambles it was in during the 90s, it is still enormously far from a peer force to NATO in a non-nuclear European conflict. Indeed his interference in Ukraine was an attempt to either stop Ukraine from entering EU and NATO whereupon it would become impenetrable to Russian interests, or to split Ukraine and paralyze it with a frozen war if Western Ukraine remained determined to align itself with Western sponsors (which has been the case).   Having a bunch of frozen wars on your borders is not a great foreign policy (just ask all the Russian mothers who don\\'t even know how or where their sons were killed) but it achieves the goal of maintaining the geopolitical buffer between Russia and EU/NATO. This is fopo from a position of weakness, not strength.  This is why many people kind of laughed at Romney\\'s statement that Russia is our #1 geopolitical adversary. He was wrong then and he\\'s still wrong even after Crimea and Ukraine and Syria.  US FOPO under Obama was to reposition US forces to \\'contain\\' China\\'s ambitions. Problem with this is that Trump is anti-TPP which was one of our main diplomatic moves (I\\'m not saying it\\'s a good deal, just that it in part achieves the goal of uniting and aligning China\\'s neighbors under US umbrella, ella, eh instead of Chinese). In addition, Trump as of this summer clearly did not have a fucking *clue* what the South China Sea was, what China was doing there or why it was important. It\\'s also not clear that anyone on his advisory team gives a fuck.  With all these things being said, **illiberalism** and **authoritarianism** will always be spread abroad by Russia moreso than by China. The Chinese just want a multilateral world order so they can be illiberal and authoritarian to their own people. Russia wants to destroy the West as we know it. The discontent in China comes from domestic sources that want human rights and a better life, and from a vague knowledge (mediated by the Internet and an outsider-connected business class on the coasts) that other people elsewhere have these things. The discontent in Russia comes from Europe being right next door holding a bangin\\' freedom party, one that Russian leaders continually have to deceive and intimidate their own people into believing is actually an impending disaster. In addition, Russian leaders will always feel threatened by a united Europe especially one united under Germany (and make no mistake, ever since reunification the EU has been a project led by and for the German state. The imposition of austerity on Southern Europe and Britain\\'s exit from the union accelerate the identification of the EU with mostly and perhaps eventually solely German interests. A surprising part of history that few learn in the USA is that the leaders of France and UK were both dismayed by the speed of German reunification. Anyway, that\\'s a sidenote).   Long story short, China is the USA\\'s geopolitical adversary, but Russia is more of a threat to the West\\'s domestic political scene than China is. Yet it is exactly in this sense that Trump admires Putin as a \"strong leader.\"',\n",

That\\'s what gave people the energy and courage to proudly and publicly identify as Obama supporters across the nation. It was the engine of the Obama-Dean **\"Fifty State Strategy,\"** something we desperately need to revive if we ever want to successfully impeach Trump.

MoveOn is a [political action committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoveOn) that gathers emails for fundraising purposes, mainly spamming people for small-dollar donations to the Congressional party committee before every 2-year election. As far as I can see, little actual organizing or logistics work on the protests is being done by MoveOn. As we saw when they tried to trigger the protests after Sessions was fired, many of the events were not real (or placeholders, to put it charitably) and were canceled overnight by the purported organizers, **leaving people in red and purple states scrambling to actually put together a protest event.**   This is bad. Nobody in LA or New York is going to need MoveOn to tell them to protest when shit goes down - the entire city will be on the street. A pre-emergency organizing system is a necessity mostly for small towns, suburbs and rural areas, where you\\'re not sure *if there will be* a protest or *where to find it* - and that\\'s where the system *failed the most* in the last protest attempt.  I say this not to throw shit at MoveOn but because people need to be informed citizens. There are tons of fake groups trying to get your email for political fundraising. An example is all those YouTube popunder ads you see like \"DO YOU SUPPORT TRUMP? VOTE IN POLL\" pretending to be real polls. They\\'re not, they\\'re Republican organizations trying to harvest the emails of Trump supporters. Another example is fake petitions, like [this \"petition\" invitation currently on the front page of a leading left-leaning website](https://i.imgur.com/fs0Xqq7.jpg). There is no petition, they just want your name, email and zipcode so they can send you Democratic fundraising emails.  **We absolutely need** a Mueller Rapid Response but the organizing and logistics have to come from we the people.   #Start organizing in your local communities, reaching out to people you know and building a \"Scouring Of The Shire\" telephone tree.   To my fellow avocado Millennials (Buscemi.bmp) who don\\'t know what a phone tree is, this was an old system people used before the internet to organize things in case of emergency. Each person knows they have a responsibility to call 3 or 4 people below them on the \"tree,\" and each of THOSE people have a list to call. It\\'s like a pyramid scheme, but used for good. **No more canceled events this way. You know why?** Because instead of people chickening out with \"well I\\'m not gonna go because I can\\'t leave work / I don\\'t feel safe / I don\\'t have time to make a sign / I didn\\'t buy any bottled water\" you give everyone in the organization a small but meaningful task to do that they CAN\\'T chicken out of. If I don\\'t call, those 3 or 4 people aren\\'t going to get their alert. But if I do call, right away I feel solidarity with the people I\\'m alerting. Together we are already a small group encouraging each other. Everyone else is going so why not me?  I call it the Scouring Of The Shire telephone tree because it\\'s literally what Frodo and Sam did when they came back to the Shire and found out Saruman was wrecking shit. Frodo sent Sam to wake up Farmer Cotton and Merry to wake up the Brandybucks, and each of *them* woke up some more people, and the entire Shire was wide awake by 4 AM (fucking PJ didn\\'t put this epic scene in the movie but still).  I can\\'t say this strongly enough (in fact, to borrow a phrase from Trump, I\\'m going to say it **very strongly and greatly**): if you rely on MoveOn, or Sheriff Mueller to do the work of reclaiming democracy for you, we\\'re going to lose America. If you start organizing on the ground right now for the coming emergency, we may save America. Up to y\\'all.',\n",

This is the conservatism that came into full flower with Ronald Reagan and Newt Gingrich, and of which the \"neoconservatives\" of the Bush administration saw themselves as the inheritors. To build this new respectable conservatism Buckley and Reagan had to purge their party of the outright antisemites and conspiratards. The Alex Joneses of that day were part of something called the John Birch Society. Buckley publicly trashed them. And for the next 40 years whenever the Old Right threatened to come back, the Reaganists were there to fight them off. But with the end of the Cold War, the demise of the Christian Right, the hollowing out of industrial America by neoliberalism and technology, and the miserable self discrediting failures of the neoconservatives, the stage was set for an increasingly rotten house to fall in on itself. This is the larger perspective: the Right has always been a pack of paranoid conspiratard racists, and the \"conservatism\" that defined the end of the 20tj century was an intermission between two eras of bat shit craziness.

The far right always had people like Limbaugh and Drudge of course. But before 2005, talk radio and internet were outside the gates. Drudge and Hannity were hangers-on to the Bush Presidency, not its motive force.

In fact studies of the actual witch hunts in Europe showed that often people accused others just to get their land. So the number of people accusing Trump doesn\\'t really sway me.  **What does make these allegations credible** is that the victims described them to their friends shortly after it happened, that this was years or decades before the \"I don\\'t wait, I just start kissing them, they let you grab them by the pussy\" tape came out, and yet the details match the words coming out of Trump\\'s own mouth.  In fact people seem to not remember this other part from the Trump tape:  &gt; #TRUMP: I moved on her very heavily. In fact, I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. I said, “I’ll show you where they have some nice furniture.” I took her out furniture - I moved on her like a bitch. But I couldn’t get there.  Which is exactly what happened here. He was in a store with a woman, took her to a place where other people couldn\\'t see, and started attacking her. How could E. Jean Carroll know ***TRUMP\\'S SELF DESCRIBED M.O.*** if she was fabricating an allegation? The answer is she wasn\\'t and it happened.',\n",

       " 'I keep seeing that M4A is now just a \"bargaining chip\" so we can eventually make a compromise and get a public option.  As someone who\\'s been for the public option since 2010, that sounds like a fascinating *half* of an argument that I would like to hear more of... but my question is **Who**?  Who is Bernie negotiating with? Who is going to be so frightened of M4A that they \"negotiate it down\" to giving us the public option?  - It won\\'t be Senate Republicans who are guaranteed to vote against cloture on any further healthcare proposal no matter how radical OR moderate it is  - It won\\'t be the the new Representatives who won election in 2018 [largely thanks to specifically refusing](http://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/medicare-for-all-a-vote-loser-in-2018-u-s-house-elections/) to adopt a M4A plank and promising their independence from the national party, while Bernie\\'s Our Revolution candidates got [completely wiped out in swing districts](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/progressives-plan-victory-just-took-gut-punch-now-what-do-n933771)  - It won\\'t be the future swing-district Democrats that we improbably expect to add in 2020 despite Bernie at the top of their ticket telling purple state voters that he is for M4A (and wouldn\\'t we elect more of those Dems anyway if we were just honest about wanting a public option?)  - It won\\'t be \"the entrenched corporate interests in the media and the insurance industry\" because they are politically high-info enough to know what Klobuchar said over and over, M4A cannot even command a supermajority of the Democratic Senate caucus, you can\\'t threaten something that can\\'t happen!  So like... who are we negotiating this with? And if a public option **IS** a good plan then why has Bernie been trashing Pete Buttigieg, John Delaney, Amy Klobuchar, Joe Biden, and a number of other presidential candidates who ran on exactly that plan?!',\n",
