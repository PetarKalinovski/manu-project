       "    'text': '  To all those who claim the Mueller investigation is a \"witch hunt\", let\\'s look at the facts, shall we? There already have been a number of people indicted as well as those who have plead guilty, including Popadopolous for lying about contacts with Russians, Gates for doing the same, Flynn for lying about contacts with Russians, Manafort -- Trump\\'s former campaign chairman – for corruption and tax evasion (the lesser of the many charges possible against him), many Russian intelligence officers (GRU), the Russian Internet Research Agency (the troll farm), and Putin\\'s right hand man Prigozhin. My hunch is that after January 3, when there will be some protection in Congress for Mueller\\'s investigation, other indictments will follow, including probably Julian Assange (sealed indictment already leaked), Carter Page, and Trump Campaign Advisor Roger Stone. In Stone\\'s case, he already has admitted contact with one of the main hackers, Gucifer 2.0, identified as a GRU officer, and Wikileaks, the vehicle the Russians chose to divulge the emails they had hacked. But let\\'s not term Stone\\'s role as collusion; let\\'s use the legal term of conspiracy. Also, we haven\\'t even touched upon Trump\\'s obstruction of justice. His goose is cooked and he knows it and he is now frantic. All he can do is try to discredit the investigation and the judiciary by manipulating the press. But it is too late. Witch hunt? Indeed.

       "    'text': 'The Republican-controlled legislature has more control over the State Election Board. Page 8: There is created a state board to be known as the State Election Board, to be composed of t̶h̶e̶ ̶S̶e̶c̶r̶e̶t̶a̶r̶y̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶S̶t̶a̶t̶e̶ a chairperson elected by the General Assembly, an elector to be elected by a majority vote of the Senate of the General Assembly at its regular session held in each odd-numbered year, an elector to be elected by a majority vote of the House of Representatives of the General Assembly at its regular session held in each odd-numbered year, and a member of each political party to be nominated and appointed in the manner provided in this Code section. No person while a member of the General Assembly shall serve as a member of the board. This is one of a few provisions that strip power from the secretary of state and indirectly shift it to the legislature by creating a new chair of the State Election Board. Previously, the secretary of state had served in that role.  The law dictates that the newly created chair be “nonpartisan,” but the position is appointed through the partisan legislature. Voting rights groups say this amounts to the legislature’s exerting more control over the State Election Board and election oversight in general.  The provision does contain some partisan guardrails: In the two years immediately preceding a chair’s appointment, he or she cannot have been a candidate for public office or have made any political campaign contributions.  But it also looks an awful lot like a revenge move: Republican lawmakers are taking power away from Mr. Raffensperger, who infuriated Mr. Trump and some G.O.P. leaders in the state by rebuffing the former president’s fraud claims.  The secretary of state is removed as a voting member of the State Election Board. Page 11: The Secretary of State shall be t̶h̶e̶ ̶c̶h̶a̶i̶r̶p̶e̶r̶s̶o̶n̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶b̶o̶a̶r̶d̶ an ex officio nonvoting member of the board. Three voting members of the board shall constitute a quorum, and no vacancy on the board shall impair the right of the quorum to exercise all the powers and perform all the duties of the board. The board shall adopt a seal for its use and bylaws for its own government and procedure. This is a more direct attack on the powers of the secretary of state, effectively eliminating that person’s voice on the State Election Board.  Viewed through the lens of the 2020 election, this could be seen as revenge for Georgia Republicans against the current secretary of state, Mr. Raffensperger, who would not capitulate to Mr. Trump’s demands to overturn the results under a false banner of fraud.  The G.O.P.-led legislature is empowered to suspend county election officials. Page 11: The State Election Board may suspend county or municipal superintendents and appoint an individual to serve as the temporary superintendent in a jurisdiction. Such individual shall exercise all the powers and duties of a superintendent as provided by law, including the authority to make all personnel decisions related to any employees of the jurisdiction who assist with carrying out the duties of the superintendent, including, but not limited to, the director of elections, the election supervisor, and all poll officers. (g) At no time shall the State Election Board suspend more than four county or municipal superintendents pursuant to subsection (f) of this Code section. Another power play by Republican state lawmakers. Tensions have long simmered between state and county election officials in Georgia, particularly in Fulton County, the largest Democratic hub in the state, where officials say they have been targeted and deprived of support by Republicans at the state level. Election officials in Fulton County, for their part, have had their historical share of mistakes and mismanagement.  Now the State Election Board, newly influenced by the partisan Legislature, will have the power to suspend county election officials. That part of the new law alarmed some Democratic legislators, who noted that it could particularly affect counties like Fulton, which contains 15 percent of those in the state who voted Democratic in the November election.  The law does state that the bar for suspension is high: either a minimum of three clear violations of State Election Board rules, or “demonstrated nonfeasance, malfeasance, or gross negligence in the administration of the elections” in two consecutive elections.  In the event of a suspension, the State Election Board would name a temporary replacement.  https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/us/politics/georgia-voting-law-annotated.amp.html',\n",

There already have been a number of people indicted as well as those who have plead guilty, including Popadopolous for lying about contacts with Russians, Gates for doing the same, Flynn for lying about contacts with Russians, Manafort -- Trump\\'s former campaign chairman – for corruption and tax evasion (the lesser of the many charges possible against him), many Russian intelligence officers (GRU), the Russian Internet Research Agency (the troll farm), and Putin\\'s right hand man Prigozhin. My hunch is that after January 3, when there will be some protection in Congress for Mueller\\'s investigation, other indictments will follow, including probably Julian Assange (sealed indictment already leaked), Carter Page, and Trump Campaign Advisor Roger Stone. In Stone\\'s case, he already has admitted contact with one of the main hackers, Gucifer 2.0, identified as a GRU officer, and Wikileaks, the vehicle the Russians chose to divulge the emails they had hacked. But let\\'s not term Stone\\'s role as collusion; let\\'s use the legal term of conspiracy. Also, we haven\\'t even touched upon Trump\\'s obstruction of justice. His goose is cooked and he knows it and he is now frantic. All he can do is try to discredit the investigation and the judiciary by manipulating the press. But it is too late. Witch hunt? Indeed.

Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) told Russia’s foreign minister that while Russia and the United States were competitors, “we don’t necessarily need to be adversaries.” … “I’m not here today to accuse Russia of this or that or so forth,” Shelby told Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin.  In addition to Shelby, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee and has limited foreign policy responsibilities, the official congressional delegation featured Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Sen.

       "    'text': 'The Republican-controlled legislature has more control over the State Election Board. Page 8: There is created a state board to be known as the State Election Board, to be composed of t̶h̶e̶ ̶S̶e̶c̶r̶e̶t̶a̶r̶y̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶S̶t̶a̶t̶e̶ a chairperson elected by the General Assembly, an elector to be elected by a majority vote of the Senate of the General Assembly at its regular session held in each odd-numbered year, an elector to be elected by a majority vote of the House of Representatives of the General Assembly at its regular session held in each odd-numbered year, and a member of each political party to be nominated and appointed in the manner provided in this Code section. No person while a member of the General Assembly shall serve as a member of the board. This is one of a few provisions that strip power from the secretary of state and indirectly shift it to the legislature by creating a new chair of the State Election Board. Previously, the secretary of state had served in that role.  The law dictates that the newly created chair be “nonpartisan,” but the position is appointed through the partisan legislature. Voting rights groups say this amounts to the legislature’s exerting more control over the State Election Board and election oversight in general.  The provision does contain some partisan guardrails: In the two years immediately preceding a chair’s appointment, he or she cannot have been a candidate for public office or have made any political campaign contributions.  But it also looks an awful lot like a revenge move: Republican lawmakers are taking power away from Mr. Raffensperger, who infuriated Mr. Trump and some G.O.P. leaders in the state by rebuffing the former president’s fraud claims.  The secretary of state is removed as a voting member of the State Election Board. Page 11: The Secretary of State shall be t̶h̶e̶ ̶c̶h̶a̶i̶r̶p̶e̶r̶s̶o̶n̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶b̶o̶a̶r̶d̶ an ex officio nonvoting member of the board. Three voting members of the board shall constitute a quorum, and no vacancy on the board shall impair the right of the quorum to exercise all the powers and perform all the duties of the board. The board shall adopt a seal for its use and bylaws for its own government and procedure. This is a more direct attack on the powers of the secretary of state, effectively eliminating that person’s voice on the State Election Board.  Viewed through the lens of the 2020 election, this could be seen as revenge for Georgia Republicans against the current secretary of state, Mr. Raffensperger, who would not capitulate to Mr. Trump’s demands to overturn the results under a false banner of fraud.  The G.O.P.-led legislature is empowered to suspend county election officials. Page 11: The State Election Board may suspend county or municipal superintendents and appoint an individual to serve as the temporary superintendent in a jurisdiction. Such individual shall exercise all the powers and duties of a superintendent as provided by law, including the authority to make all personnel decisions related to any employees of the jurisdiction who assist with carrying out the duties of the superintendent, including, but not limited to, the director of elections, the election supervisor, and all poll officers. (g) At no time shall the State Election Board suspend more than four county or municipal superintendents pursuant to subsection (f) of this Code section. Another power play by Republican state lawmakers. Tensions have long simmered between state and county election officials in Georgia, particularly in Fulton County, the largest Democratic hub in the state, where officials say they have been targeted and deprived of support by Republicans at the state level. Election officials in Fulton County, for their part, have had their historical share of mistakes and mismanagement.  Now the State Election Board, newly influenced by the partisan Legislature, will have the power to suspend county election officials. That part of the new law alarmed some Democratic legislators, who noted that it could particularly affect counties like Fulton, which contains 15 percent of those in the state who voted Democratic in the November election.  The law does state that the bar for suspension is high: either a minimum of three clear violations of State Election Board rules, or “demonstrated nonfeasance, malfeasance, or gross negligence in the administration of the elections” in two consecutive elections.  In the event of a suspension, the State Election Board would name a temporary replacement.  https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/us/politics/georgia-voting-law-annotated.amp.html',\n",

       "    'text': 'Tammy’s an amazing woman, a fighter and very well liked. For me personally, she’s too conservative in her voting record but I understand why people laud her incredible life story. Here’s my case for Kamala:  I strongly believe the left have sadly gotten Kamala very wrong and I think she’s just as strong a choice as any for VP, especially as a VP to Joe Biden in particular.   Reddit and “progressive” media (a la Intercept, TYT, Jacobin, Secular talk etc) have a hate boner for Kamala in particular. The entire ‘Kamala is an evil cop who locked up more black people than any one ever!!!1’ is largely a political hitjob from supporters of her primary opponents and is not at all representative of her actual record.  She votes very progressively in the senate (only behind Ed Markey): https://progressivepunch.org/scores.htm?house=senate. She’s pragmatic and works hard to get progress made rather than milling in platitudes. She’s been one of the most effective senators in just her first term for this.  Biden, a famous coalition builder has said he wants someone “simpatico” with him. She’s left of him on many topics, but she is similar to him in this collaborative approach. He has said he wants someone ready to take over on Day 1 if needed. Senator Harris sits on the senate intelligence, budget, homeland security and judiciary committees and is very well respected/liked by her colleagues across the aisles, including by Republicans and other progressive voices in the house and senate. I’ve never really understood why online progressives hate her, when Bernie Sanders has never passed a bill he authored on police reform, immigration or equality rights, but did vote for the Crime Bill, against Brady and  for War in Afghanistan and he has collaborated with her many times.  I’ll discuss her prosecutorial record, which has been used to Swift Boat her. Firstly, DAs and Attorney Generals do not create laws. Their job is executorial, meaning they manage the office that prosecutes on behalf of the state/district law. It is their job to do this regardless of their personal feelings on the law. This is similar to how public defenders must enforce all citizen’s rights to fair representation regardless of what evil what those people might have committed. Kamala intentionally entered public service as a prosecutor because in that period, criminal justice was often led by very anti-black, anti-immigrant, anti-sex work white men. Kamala was the first black person to be AG of a state and of California - a state of 40Million people which was at the time ripe in crime. Kamala has always been pro marijuana legalization but lived in a state where weed was illegal at that time. Any attorney general’s record for a population that huge can be cherry picked.  Against strong pushback, Harris always worked her way around enforcing the death penalty (which as wild as it sounds was supported in DA offices in California then) and she instituted the Back on Track program reducing recidivism from near the national 50% average to 10% rate. It’s so successful it’s been instituted nationwide. She had one of the best platforms imo of any candidate on immigration - as a child of immigrants herself-, on maternal healthcare and has always worked to protect California as a sanctuary state. La Opinión (popular Latinx news platform) recently endorsed her as VP recognizing this. Contrary to the disinformation campaign against her, she never once threw a single parent in jail for truancy (unlike her predecessors) and instead improved attendance rate for low-income kids by 20%, improving their standards of living, food and potential for further education. She also did not “choose not to pursue Steve Mnunchin”. She wouldn’t have been able to. She won important cases against big banks that rewarded residents in California, cleared the rape kit backlog she inherited and successfully protected sex workers and child sex abuse victims better than any of her predecessors. She was marrying same-sex couples long before it was recognised nationwide, and her fighting Prop 8 in court is one of the reasons same sex marriage was legalized nationally. If you’re skeptical, here is a thorough debunking of the common falsities stated about her record: https://medium.com/@blackwomenviews/debunking-the-lies-smears-and-distortions-about-kamala-harris-1718881a0ec3?source=---------5------------------.  Kamala has been calling for recurring payments for middle class/working class families in America since 2018 through her Lift Act: https://slate.com/business/2018/10/kamala-harris-middle-class-tax-plan.amp. In response to coronavirus, she authored a bill granting $2000 a month for Americans for the duration of this crisis: https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/06/02/kamala-harris-and-andrew-yang-renew-call-for-2000-a-month-stimulus-check/amp/. You can read more of her evidence-backed record here: https://medium.com/@blackwomenviews/credentials-not-cosmetics-the-case-for-kamala-harris-for-vp-39df9caede86.  By sweeping the DA, AG and senate elections in California (the 8th largest economy in the world) all on her first attempts, she is technically the most accomplished black female elected official ever in the United States and one of the most accomplished black female politicians in the world.  Recent polls and surveys eg Northwestern’s: shorturl.at/yBDRS, USA Today’s: shorturl.at/nwPRW, shorturl.at/nwDIM, MonMouth’s: shorturl.at/rxz19 and YouGov’s: shorturl.at/citD5 show she has strong support in the party.  YouGov’s recent polling shows Harris is the most favored among all voters (Harris 24%, Warren 18%, Abrams 9%), among black voters (Harris 21%, Warren 19%, Abrams 14%) and Latinx voters (Harris 37%, Warren 16%, Abrams 6%) for VP. Source; https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/cjd35jrh5o/econTabReport.pdf. In particular, the vast majority of black people have always polled at a majority for any black female VP, even when Warren was the specific favourite (mostly due to name recognition). The data also suggests the black turnout and Hispanic enthusiasm will be greater with a black woman on the ticket.  Why is this important? Because white people haven’t voted a democrat for president since 1964, but black women voted 94% for Hillary Clinton. Black women got Doug Jones elected in Alabama because of their incredible turnout and the fact they universally voted for him. No other group votes like this. Although those of us that did vote in 2016 voted overwhelmingly anti-Trump, Clinton lost partly because enthusiasm among black voters was down sharply. Black voters aren’t going to vote for Trump, but a lot of people might not be incentivized to participate this year. If we as black women are saying we will more enthusiastically and collectively vote if a black woman is on the ticket, it is very valid for us to be listened to. This year will be mired by voter suppression and COVID related fears. It can’t be over stressed how vital our turnout is for democratic elections. Bakari Sellers illustrates this point using his mother here: https://twitter.com/firinglineshow/status/1273284266600755200?s=21. Also notable is women were invaluable in flipping the house in 2018 and white women strongly favour Kamala for VP. Also, Hispanic voters are the only demo Biden is currently lagging behind Clinton on. Kamala polls more than double the next choice in this demo.  In the last few months, she has become even more present in the media discussing reform in law enforcement to protect vulnerable communities and debunking misunderstandings about defunding the police (a stance she has had since 2006: https://twitter.com/adamjsmithga/status/1269761430322139136?s=21). You wouldn’t know from Reddit but Kamala has a dedicated and passionate supporter base mostly on twitter who helped her raise 3.5M for Biden in a recent fundraiser and strongly advocate for her. She also threw a “joyful warrior” party with DJs this weekend to raise everyone’s spirits (and $1M!) right before jumping to an interview to critique Barr’s continued corruption.  Harris also has a personal relationship with the Biden family as she was friends with his son Beau before he died. Kamala spoke at Beau’s funeral. The clash during the primaries over bussing has reportedly been shaken off not just by Joe but also Jill Biden who likes Kamala: shorturl.at/vTWY5. They’ve had events together and Jill was defending her from Meghan McCain a while ago. Jill is also close with Kamala’s husband from the campaign trail. Biden said unsavory things about Obama before he was chosen as VP. After the debate he told her “go easy on me kid”. He said at a fundraiser they did together last month that she “loved him and loved Beau” and he’d not forget that.  Many people will tell you choosing her as VP is “tokenistic” and “identity politics”, erasing her accomplishments and real record. To my dismay as a black woman who identifies as quite far-left, I get the impression my wing of the party believe class subsumes race and you cannot be progressive, involved in justice and God forbid be POC at the same time. It also shows they don’t understand how important representation is to us black people. Imo, Kamala has been harshly judged and written off. I keep seeing articles about how she would only be a “symbolic” or “cosmetic”. As someone who knows her record really well, it’s sad to me. I wonder how good we have to be to be good enough. It feels like unconscious biases and misogynoir.  (1/2)',\n",

Because white people haven’t voted a democrat for president since 1964, but black women voted 94% for Hillary Clinton. Black women got Doug Jones an upset victory in Alabama because of their incredible turnout and the fact they universally voted for him. No other group votes like this. Although those of us that did vote in 2016 voted overwhelmingly anti-Trump, she lost partly because turnout among black voters was down sharply. [Bakari Sellers illustrates this point using his mother here.](https://twitter.com/firinglineshow/status/1273284266600755200?s=21). White women were invaluable in flipping the house in 2018: white women support Kamala for VP.  In the last few months, she has been ever present in the media discussing reform and misunderstanding about defunding the police ([a stance she has had since 2006](https://twitter.com/adamjsmithga/status/1269761430322139136?s=21)). Also, although Biden is polling high, his one issue is enthusiasm. You wouldn’t know from Reddit but Kamala has a dedicated and passionate supporter base mostly on twitter called the KHive, her “joyful warriors” who helped her raise 3.5M for Biden in a recent fundraiser and strongly advocate for her.  Harris has a personal relationship with the Biden family as she was friends with his son Beau (who was AG of Delaware) before he died. Biden swore her into office, she campaigned both times for him/Obama, he had her speak at Beau’s funeral. The clash during the primaries over bussing has been shaken off not just by Joe but also [Jill Biden who said her granddaughters look up to her](https://www.politico.com/amp/news/2020/05/10/kamala-harris-early-biden-vice-president-favorite-248615). All the media speculation about Biden holding a grudge is them reaching imo. Biden said unsavory things about Obama before he was chosen as VP: he is famously a great coalition builder and is able to shrug things off for mutual benefit. After the debate he told her “go easy on me kid”. He said at a fundraiser they did together recently that she “loved him and loved Beau” and he’d not forget that.  Is she perfect? No. Susan Rice imo is the other fierce competition. Rice has great foreign policy experience and is excellent at criticizing Trump’s administration. But she’s never campaigned for or won an election in her life, while Kamala has won all her statewide elections (by 30 points in the last one). Also, Rice has a very vocal Trump supporting son. Biden’s expertise is foreign policy and he’s said he wants someone that balances his weak points - Kamala has loads of local and state wide experience and an understanding of the flawed justice system. Activists and critics have also walked back their unfair attacks on her from the primaries -[including Shaun King who peddled an insane lie that she had framed his friend for murder.](https://www.politico.com/amp/news/2020/06/07/kamala-harris-biden-criminal-justice-reform-304534)  Another benefit of Kamala is the star power she will bring to the virtual campaign trail and debates. She doesn’t need to be introduced to the public in the next three months. As has been seen from Karen Bass going from “safe choice” to “scandalous” overnight, there is huge value in already being vetted on the national stage. She has recently done loads of late night appearances, IG lives and fundraisers for Biden, eg with Sarah Cooper (who goes viral for her Trump impersonations and adores Kamala), Diplo and other DJs. Maya Rudolph just got nominated for an Emmy playing her on SNL. Kamala was a strong debater at Howard University. Her interrogations of Barr, Graham, Kavanaugh etc famously show this. She can contrast Biden’s more amicable tone by switching to her attack dog mode when needed. She’s whip smart and will be glorious to watch debate Mike Pence. [Here is Sen Cornyn from Texas recently trying to catch her slipping and failing epically on the senate floor.](https://youtu.be/QCHpJkQI7T0) To me she is an exciting and strong voice to be representing Americans internationally after the disgrace we’ve had for the last few years.',\n",

The entire ‘Kamala is an evil centrist cop who locked up more black people than any one ever!!!1’ is a Swift Boating smear campaign from supporters of her primary opponents and is not at all representative of her actual record.

Harris sits on the senate intelligence, budget, homeland security and judiciary committees.  DAs and Attorney Generals do not create laws.

Kamala intentionally entered public service as a prosecutor because in that period, criminal justice was often led by very anti-black, anti-immigrant, anti-sex work white men.

I hate that people try to turn her competency in on its head. Harris is excellently good at any job she’s given.

Contrary to the disinformation campaign against her, she never once threw a single parent in jail for truancy (unlike her predecessors) and instead improved attendance rate for low-income kids by 20%, improving their standards of living, health and potential for further education. She secured $25Billion from predatory banks for residents in California, cleared the rape kit backlog she inherited, knocked down the gay/trans panic defense and successfully protected sex workers and child sex abuse victims better than any of her predecessors. She was marrying same-sex couples long before it was recognised nationwide, and her fighting Prop 8 in court is one of the reasons same sex marriage was legalized nationally.

But she’s never campaigned or won an election in her life, while Kamala has won all her statewide elections (by 30 points in the last one). Also, Rice has a very vocal Trump supporting son. Biden’s expertise is foreign policy and he’s said he wants someone that balances his weak points - Kamala has loads of local and state wide experience and an understanding of the flawed justice system. Activists and critics have also walked back their unfair attacks on her from the primaries -[including Shaun King who peddled an insane lie that she had framed his friend for murder.](https://www.politico.com/amp/news/2020/06/07/kamala-harris-biden-criminal-justice-reform-304534)  Another benefit of Kamala is the star power she will bring to the virtual campaign trail and debates. She doesn’t need to be introduced to the public in the next three months. She has recently done loads of late night appearances, IG lives and fundraisers, eg with Sarah Cooper (who goes viral for her Trump impersonations and adores Kamala), Diplo and other DJs. Maya Rudolph just got nominated for an Emmy playing her on SNL. Kamala was a strong debater at Howard University. Her interrogations of Barr, Graham, Kavanaugh etc famously show this. She can contrast Biden’s more amicable tone by switching to her attack dog mode when needed. She’s whip smart and will be glorious to watch debate Mike Pence.

She has a higher net favourability than Elizabeth Warren and is currently polling as the overwhelming favourite by voters, black voters and Hispanic voters for VP. And who told you she “only” has haters? You’re blinded by the overwhelmingly white/male/Bernie leaning demographic of Reddit. She has a psssionate base of followers called the KHive made of a multiracial coalition of black women, south Asian women, LGBT people, white allies and Latinx people. They helped her raise 3.5M in her Biden fundraiser and they passionately advocate for her, make her senate floor moments go viral and push back against disinformation on her behalf.   The perspective you’re describing is not representative of Democratic party members or black people at large. Sounds like disgruntled Bernout purists who have bought the smears peddled by his surrogates. I’ll copy and paste a comment I’ve posted a whole bunch of times about why she has a very good record and why she’d be as good a pick as any:   Reddit and faux-progressive media have a hate boner for Kamala in particular. The entire ‘Kamala is an evil centrist cop who locked up more black people than any one ever!!!1’ is largely a political smear from her primary opponents and is not at all representative of her actual record.   She votes more progressive in the senate than the usual leftist faves (only behind Ed Markey): https://progressivepunch.org/scores.htm?house=senate and she dramatically reduced incarceration rates for marijuana during her tenure (https://twitter.com/pierceah66/status/1270414069376434180?s=21 ). Please note Bernie Sanders has never passed a bill he authored on police reform, immigration or equality rights, but did vote for the Crime Bill and Iraq War, so why he’s held as the standard for insane purity tests I will never understand.   Against strong pushback, Harris always refused to pursue the death penalty and she instituted the Back on Track program with 10% reoffence rate that was so successful it’s been instituted nationwide. She arguably had the most left platform of any candidate on immigration - as a child of immigrants herself-, black healthcare and has always worked to protect California as a sanctuary state. Contrary to the disinformation campaign against her, she never once threw a single parent in jail for truancy and instead improved attendance rate for low-income kids by 20%, improving their standards of living, food and potential for further education. She won important cases against big banks that rewarded residents in California, cleared the rape kit backlog she inherited and successfully protected sex workers and child sex abuse victims better than any of her predecessors. She was marrying same-sex couples long before it was recognised nationwide. You can read more of her actual, evidence-backed record here: https://medium.com/@blackwomenviews/50-criminal-justice-reforms-accomplishments-by-kamala-harris-cf314eeaad2e.   By sweeping the DA, AG and senate elections in California (the 5th largest economy in the world) all on her first attempts, she is technically the most accomplished black female elected official in the United States and one of the most accomplished black female politicians in the world.

A-rated pollster YouGov’s most recent polling actually shows Harris is the most favored among all voters (Harris 24%, Warren 18%, Abrams 9%), among black voters (Harris 21%, Warren 19%, Abrams 14%) and Latinx voters (Harris 37%, Warren 16%, Abrams 6%) for VP. Source; https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/cjd35jrh5o/econTabReport.pdf. It’s interesting to note the vast majority of black people have always polled at a majority for any black female VP, even though Warren was the specific favourite (mostly due to name recognition). The data also suggests the black turnout and Hispanic enthusiasm will be greater with a black woman on the ticket.   Why is this important? Because white people haven’t voted a democrat for president in decades, but black women voted 94% for Hillary Clinton. She lost partly because enthusiasm among black voters was down sharply. If we as black women are saying we will more enthusiastically and collectively vote if this woman is chosen, it is very valid for us to be listened to. Also, Hispanic voters is the only sector Biden is currently lagging behind Clinton on. Bakari Sellers illustrates this point using his mother here: https://twitter.com/firinglineshow/status/1273284266600755200?s=21.

She actually over-represents in favorability among black voters (the Democratic party’s most important demographic for turnout) compared with Warren who has near-universal name recognition.   Harris also has a personal relationship with the Biden family as she was friends with his son Beau before he died.

The faux-progressive parts of left-Reddit will tell you choosing her as VP is “tokenistic” and “identity politics”, erasing her accomplishments and real record. To my dismay as a black woman who identifies as quite far-left, I have realized a lot of “progressives” who supported Bernie and even Warren believe class subsumes race and you cannot be progressive, involved in justice and God forbid be POC at the same time. It also shows they don’t understand how important representation is to us black people and also they are steeped in misogynoir.   Is she perfect? No. She was working in an imperfect system as AG and DA and arguably should have pushed even harder. But she did much much more than her predecessors, inspired many other POC and women in DA and AG positions to go even further than she did and has spent her entire time as a legislator pushing for reform and progressive change that makes it easier. She is beloved among progressive reformers (many she mentored) in different state and district offices in the country for this reason.

       "    'text': 'You’re correct about the timing she entered San Fransisco/California politics and it’s a nuance many people miss. Here’s my take on why the left have sadly gotten Kamala very wrong and why I think she’s just as strong a choice as any for VP:  Reddit and “progressive” media (a la Intercept, TYT, Jacobin, Secular talk etc) have a hate boner for Kamala in particular. The entire ‘Kamala is an evil cop who locked up more black people than any one ever!!!1’ is largely a political hitjob from supporters of her primary opponents and is not at all representative of her actual record.  She votes very progressively in the senate, more than the usual leftist faves (only behind Ed Markey): https://progressivepunch.org/scores.htm?house=senate and she dramatically reduced incarceration rates for marijuana during her tenure (https://twitter.com/pierceah66/status/1270414069376434180?s=21 ). But she’s pragmatic and works hard to get progress made rather than milling in platitudes. She’s been one of the most effective senators in just her first term for this.  Biden has said he wants someone “simpatico” with him. She might be very much on the left of him on many topics, but she is similar to him in this collaborative approach. He has said he wants someone ready to take over on Day 1 if needed. Senator Harris sits on the senate intelligence, budget, homeland security and judiciary committees and is very well respected/liked by her colleagues across the aisles, including by other progressive voices in the house and senate. Very online progressives hate her. Please note Bernie Sanders has never passed a bill he authored on police reform, immigration or equality rights, but did vote for the Crime Bill, against Brady and  for War in Afghanistan. I like Bernie’s policies too but why he’s held as the standard for unattainable purity tests I will never understand.  I’ll discuss her prosecutorial record. Firstly, **DAs and Attorney Generals do not create laws. Their job is executorial, meaning they manage the office that prosecutes on behalf of the state/district law.** It is their job to do this regardless of their personal feelings on the law. This is similar to how public defenders must enforce all citizen’s rights to fair representation regardless of what evil what those people might have committed. Kamala intentionally entered public service as a prosecutor because in that period, criminal justice was often led by very anti-black, anti-immigrant, anti-sex work white men. Kamala was the first black person to be AG of a state and of California - a state of 40Million people which was at the time ripe in crime. Any attorney general’s record for a population that huge can be cherry picked.  Against strong pushback, Harris always worked her way around enforcing the death penalty (which as wild as it sounds was supported in DA offices in California then) and she instituted the Back on Track program with 10% recidivism rate that is so successful it’s been instituted nationwide. The national average was almost 50% when she entered the office. She had one of the best platforms imo of any candidate on immigration - as a child of immigrants herself-, on maternal healthcare and has always worked to protect California as a sanctuary state. La Opinión (popular Latinx news platform) recently endorsed her as VP recognizing this. Contrary to the disinformation campaign against her, she never once threw a single parent in jail for truancy (unlike her predecessors) and instead improved attendance rate for low-income kids by 20%, improving their standards of living, food and potential for further education. She also did not “choose not to pursue Steve Mnunchin”. She wouldn’t have been able to. She won important cases against big banks that rewarded residents in California, cleared the rape kit backlog she inherited and successfully protected sex workers and child sex abuse victims better than any of her predecessors. She was marrying same-sex couples long before it was recognised nationwide, and her fighting Prop 8 in court is one of the reasons same sex marriage was legalized nationally. If you’re skeptical, here is a thorough debunking of the common falsities stated about her record: https://medium.com/@blackwomenviews/debunking-the-lies-smears-and-distortions-about-kamala-harris-1718881a0ec3?source=---------5------------------.

A-rated pollster YouGov’s recent polling shows Harris is the most favored among all voters (Harris 24%, Warren 18%, Abrams 9%), among black voters (Harris 21%, Warren 19%, Abrams 14%) and Latinx voters (Harris 37%, Warren 16%, Abrams 6%) for VP.

It’s interesting to note the vast majority of black people have always polled at a majority for any black female VP, even when Warren was the specific favourite (mostly due to name recognition). The data also suggests the black turnout and Hispanic enthusiasm will be greater with a black woman on the ticket.  Why is this important? Because white people haven’t voted a democrat for president since 1964, but black women voted 94% for Hillary Clinton. Black women got Doug Jones elected in Alabama because of their incredible turnout and the fact they universally voted for him. No other group votes like this. Although those of us that did vote in 2016 voted overwhelmingly anti-Trump, Clinton lost partly because enthusiasm among black voters was down sharply. If we as black women are saying we will more enthusiastically and collectively vote if a black woman is on the ticket, it is very valid for us to be listened to. It can’t be over stressed how vital our turnout is for democratic elections. Bakari Sellers illustrates this point using his mother here: https://twitter.com/firinglineshow/status/1273284266600755200?s=21. White women were invaluable in flipping the house in 2018: white women strongly favour Kamala for VP. Also, Hispanic voters are the only demo Biden is currently lagging behind Clinton on. Kamala polls more than double the next choice in this demo.  Kamala is a firebrand and a youthful figure. In the last few months, she has become even more present in the media discussing reform in law enforcement to protect vulnerable communities and debunking misunderstandings about defunding the police (a stance she has had since 2006: https://twitter.com/adamjsmithga/status/1269761430322139136?s=21 ). She actually over-represents in favorability among black voters (the Democratic party’s most important demographic for turnout) compared with Warren who has near-universal name recognition. You wouldn’t know from Reddit but Kamala has a dedicated and passionate supporter base mostly on twitter who helped her raise 3.5M for Biden in a recent fundraiser and strongly advocate for her.  1/2',\n",

The entire ‘Kamala is an evil centrist cop who locked up more black people than any one ever!!!1’ is largely a political smear from her primary opponents and is not at all representative of her actual record.   She votes more progressive in the senate than the usual leftist faves (only behind Ed Markey): https://progressivepunch.org/scores.htm?house=senate and she dramatically reduced incarceration rates for marijuana during her tenure (https://twitter.com/pierceah66/status/1270414069376434180?s=21 ). Please note Bernie Sanders has never passed a bill he authored on police reform, immigration or equality rights, but did vote for the Crime Bill and Iraq War, so why he’s held as the standard for unattainable purity tests I will never understand.   Against strong pushback, Harris always refused to pursue the death penalty and she instituted the Back on Track program with 10% reoffence rate that was so successful it’s been instituted nationwide. She arguably had the most left platform of any candidate on immigration - as a child of immigrants herself-, black healthcare and has always worked to protect California as a sanctuary state. Contrary to the disinformation campaign against her, she never once threw a single parent in jail for truancy and instead improved attendance rate for low-income kids by 20%, improving their standards of living, food and potential for further education. She won important cases against big banks that rewarded residents in California, cleared the rape kit backlog she inherited and successfully protected sex workers and child sex abuse victims better than any of her predecessors.

She actually over-represents in favorability among black voters (the Democratic party’s most important demographic for turnout) compared with Warren who has near-universal name recognition.   Harris also has a personal relationship with the Biden family as she was friends with his son Beau before he died.

The fauxgressive part of left-Reddit will tell you choosing her as VP is “tokenistic” and “identity politics”, erasing her accomplishments and real record. To my dismay as a black woman who identifies as quite far-left, I have realized a lot of “progressives” who supported Bernie and even Warren believe class subsumes race and you cannot be progressive, involved in justice and God forbid be POC at the same time. It also shows they don’t understand how important representation is to us black people and also they are steeped in misogynoir.   Is she perfect? No. She was working in an imperfect system as AG and DA and arguably should have pushed even harder. But she did much much more than her predecessors, inspired many other POC and women in DA and AG positions to go even further than she did and has spent her entire time as a legislator pushing for reform and progressive change that makes it easier. She is admired among progressive reformers (many she mentored) in different state and district offices in the country for this reason. Activists and critics have also walked back their unfair attacks on her from the primaries (including fraud Shaun King who peddled an insane lie that she had framed his friend for murder): https://www.politico.com/amp/news/2020/06/07/kamala-harris-biden-criminal-justice-reform-304534  and https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/amp/Spotlight-on-Kamala-Harris-exposes-solitude-of-15353787.php and https://www.npr.org/2020/06/22/881017398/kamala-harris-is-seen-as-the-clear-front-runner-to-be-joe-bidens-running-mate.

She votes same as Bernie for almost all budgets, and was always going to vote no on this entire budget bill. Bernie’s amendment was a poorly constructed 400 point amendment and she didn’t appreciate the very handwave-y way it re-allocated funds. It is also ridiculous to make this kind of amendment in a year like this. She explains explicitly why she voted against this amendment here: https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-statement-on-ndaa-amendment-vote.  Her statement said:   “I remain supportive of the effort, and am hopeful that with the benefit of additional time, future efforts will more specifically address these complicated issues and earn my enthusiastic support. Congress must finally make smart investments in American communities during this crisis. People across the country are hurting. Parents can’t find work, kids can’t go to school, and sick people can’t afford the health care they need. Now more than ever, we must find ways to reinvest in families and communities, which is why I have introduced the Monthly Economic Crisis Support Act with Senator Sanders and the Saving Our Street Act with Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (D-MA). Congress has a responsibility to do more—much more.”  Note Sherrod Brown and Rand Paul also voted against the amendment and this is a subject of their expertise. Harris almost always votes down Trump’s insane military budgets and this one was no exception. Harris, Warren and Sanders ended up all voting NO as well on the entire budget where this amendment was included, and once again Harris explained why:   “I am thankful for all the work negotiators did to this point, however, I voted no because Californians demand better. I could not vote for a bill that provides backdoor funding for Trump’s border wall, clears a pathway to testing a nuclear weapon for the first time in decades, and does not adequately address the scourge of sexual assault in the military. And I could not back this bill after Republicans refused to include our amendments to demilitarize police departments.”  It really frustrates me that we on the left online denigrate Harris based on whether or not she falls in line with Bernie. She actually has a more progressive voting record than Bernie, a higher rate of passing progressive legislation than Bernie and imo constructs legislation more meticulously than him. It annoys me that people purity test her using him and use no nuance to look at her record.',\n",

She votes progressively in the senate - in the top 2 or top 5 [depending on what metric](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/kamala_harris/412678) [you use](https://progressivepunch.org/scores.htm?house=senate) and she dramatically reduced incarceration rates for marijuana [during her tenure](https://twitter.com/pierceah66/status/1270414069376434180?s=21 ).  Biden said he wants someone significantly younger, so at 55 (with a very youthful appearance) she fits that. He wants someone “simpatico” with him. She‘s on the left of him, but she is similar to him in her collaborative approach. He wants someone ready to take over on Day 1 if needed. Harris sits on the senate intelligence, budget, homeland security and judiciary committees.  DAs and Attorney Generals do not create laws. Their job is executorial, meaning they manage the office that prosecutes on behalf of the state/district law. It is their job to do this regardless of their personal feelings on the law. This is similar to how public defenders must enforce all citizen’s rights to fair representation regardless of what evil what those people might have committed. Kamala intentionally entered public service as a prosecutor because in that period, criminal justice was often led by very anti-black, anti-immigrant, anti-sex work white men. Kamala was the first black person to be AG of California - a state of 40Million in 2000s harsh on crime era. Any attorney general’s record for a community that huge can be cherry picked.  I hate that people try to turn her competency in on its head. Harris is excellently good at any job she’s given. Against strong pushback, Harris legally worked her way around enforcing the death penalty and she instituted the Back on Track program with less than 10% recidivism rate that is so successful it’s been instituted nationwide. The average was 53% when she entered the office. She had one of the best platforms imo of any candidate on immigration, on maternal healthcare and has always worked to protect California as a sanctuary state. La Opinión endorsed her as VP recognizing this. Contrary to the disinformation campaign against her, she never once threw a single parent in jail for truancy (unlike her predecessors) and instead improved attendance rate for low-income kids by 20%, improving their standards of living, health and potential for further education. She secured $25Billion from predatory banks for residents in California, cleared the rape kit backlog she inherited, knocked down the gay/trans panic defense and successfully protected sex workers and child sex abuse victims better than any of her predecessors. She was marrying same-sex couples long before it was recognised nationwide, and her fighting Prop 8 in court is one of the reasons same sex marriage was legalized nationally. [If you’re skeptical, here is a thorough debunking of the common falsities stated about her record](https://medium.com/@blackwomenviews/debunking-the-lies-smears-and-distortions-about-kamala-harris-1718881a0ec3?source=---------5------------------.)  By sweeping the DA, AG and senate elections in California (the 8th largest economy in the world) all on her first attempts, she is the highest ranking black female elected official ever in the United States and one of the most accomplished black female politicians in the world.  The polls I mentioned suggest black turnout and Hispanic enthusiasm will be greater with a black woman on the ticket. Why is this important? Because white people haven’t voted a democrat for president since 1964, but black women voted 94% for Hillary Clinton. Black women got Doug Jones an upset victory in Alabama because of their incredible turnout and the fact they universally voted for him. No other group votes like this. Although those of us that did vote in 2016 voted overwhelmingly anti-Trump, she lost partly because turnout among black voters was down sharply. [Bakari Sellers illustrates this point using his mother here.](https://twitter.com/firinglineshow/status/1273284266600755200?s=21). White women were invaluable in flipping the house in 2018: white women support Kamala for VP.  In the last few months, she has been ever present in the media discussing reform and misunderstanding about defunding the police ([a stance she has had since 2006](https://twitter.com/adamjsmithga/status/1269761430322139136?s=21)). Also, although Biden is polling high, his one issue is enthusiasm. You wouldn’t know from Reddit but Kamala has a dedicated and passionate supporter base mostly on twitter called the KHive, her “joyful warriors” who helped her raise 3.5M for Biden in a recent fundraiser and strongly advocate for her.  Harris has a personal relationship with the Biden family as she was friends with his son Beau (who was AG of Delaware) before he died. Biden swore her into office, she campaigned both times for him/Obama, he had her speak at Beau’s funeral. The clash during the primaries over bussing has been shaken off not just by Joe but also [Jill Biden who said her granddaughters look up to her](https://www.politico.com/amp/news/2020/05/10/kamala-harris-early-biden-vice-president-favorite-248615). All the media speculation about Biden holding a grudge is them reaching imo. Biden said unsavory things about Obama before he was chosen as VP: he is famously a great coalition builder and is able to shrug things off for mutual benefit. After the debate he told her “go easy on me kid”. He said at a fundraiser they did together recently that she “loved him and loved Beau” and he’d not forget that.  Is she perfect? No. Susan Rice is fierce competition. Rice has great foreign policy experience and is excellent at criticizing Trump’s administration. But she’s never campaigned for or won an election in her life, while Kamala has won all her statewide elections (by 30 points in the last one). Also, Rice has a very vocal MAGA supporting son. Biden’s expertise is foreign policy and he’s said he wants someone that balances his weak points - Kamala has loads of local and state wide experience and an understanding of the flawed justice system. Activists and critics have also walked back their unfair attacks on her from the primaries -[including Shaun King who peddled an insane lie that she had framed his friend for murder.](https://www.politico.com/amp/news/2020/06/07/kamala-harris-biden-criminal-justice-reform-304534)  Another benefit of Kamala is the star power she will bring to the virtual campaign trail and debates. She doesn’t need to be introduced to the public in the next three months. As has been seen from Karen Bass going from “safe choice” to “scandalous” overnight, there is huge value in already being vetted on the national stage. She has recently done loads of late night appearances, IG lives and fundraisers for Biden, eg with Sarah Cooper (who goes viral for her Trump impersonations and adores Kamala), Diplo and other DJs. Maya Rudolph just got nominated for an Emmy playing her on SNL. Kamala was a strong debater at Howard University. Her interrogations of Barr, Graham, Kavanaugh etc famously show this. She can contrast Biden’s more amicable tone by switching to her attack dog mode when needed. She’s whip smart and will be glorious to watch debate Mike Pence.

She votes same as Bernie for almost all budgets, and was always going to vote no on this entire budget where Bernie’s amendment was contained. Bernie wrote a poorly constructed 400 point amendment and she didn’t appreciate the very handwave-y way it re-allocated funds. It is also ridiculous to make this kind of amendment in a year like this. She explains explicitly why she voted against this amendment here: https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-statement-on-ndaa-amendment-vote.  Her statement said:  “I remain supportive of the effort, and am hopeful that with the benefit of additional time, future efforts will more specifically address these complicated issues and earn my enthusiastic support. Congress must finally make smart investments in American communities during this crisis. People across the country are hurting. Parents can’t find work, kids can’t go to school, and sick people can’t afford the health care they need. Now more than ever, we must find ways to reinvest in families and communities, which is why I have introduced the Monthly Economic Crisis Support Act with Senator Sanders and the Saving Our Street Act with Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (D-MA). Congress has a responsibility to do more—much more.”  Note Sherrod Brown and Rand Paul also voted against the amendment and this is a subject of their expertise. Harris almost always votes down Trump’s insane military budgets and this one was no exception. Harris, Warren and Sanders ended up all voting NO as well on the entire budget where this amendment was included, and once again Harris explained why:  “I am thankful for all the work negotiators did to this point, however, I voted no because Californians demand better. I could not vote for a bill that provides backdoor funding for Trump’s border wall, clears a pathway to testing a nuclear weapon for the first time in decades, and does not adequately address the scourge of sexual assault in the military. And I could not back this bill after Republicans refused to include our amendments to demilitarize police departments.”  It really frustrates me that we on the left online denigrate Harris based on whether or not she falls in line with Bernie. She actually has a more progressive voting record than Bernie, a higher rate of passing progressive legislation than Bernie and imo constructs legislation more meticulously than him. It annoys me that people purity test her using him and use no nuance to look at her record.',\n",

She votes progressively in the senate - in the top 2 or top 5 [depending on what metric](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/kamala_harris/412678) [you use](https://progressivepunch.org/scores.htm?house=senate) and she dramatically reduced incarceration rates for marijuana [during her tenure](https://twitter.com/pierceah66/status/1270414069376434180?s=21 ).  Biden said he wanted someone significantly younger, so at 55 (with a very youthful appearance) she fits that. He wanted someone “simpatico” with him. She‘s on the left of him, but she is similar to him in her collaborative approach. He wanted someone ready to take over on Day 1 if needed. Harris sits on the senate intelligence, budget, homeland security and judiciary committees.  DAs and Attorney Generals do not create laws. Their job is executorial, meaning they manage the office that prosecutes on behalf of the state/district law. It is their job to do this regardless of their personal feelings on the law. This is similar to how public defenders must enforce all citizens rights to fair representation regardless of what evil what those people might have committed. Kamala intentionally entered public service as a prosecutor at a time criminal justice was often led by very anti-black, anti-immigrant, anti-sex work white men. Kamala was the first black person to be AG of California - a state of 40Million in 2000s harsh on crime era. Any attorney general’s record for a community that huge can be cherry picked.  I hate that people try to turn her competency in on its head. Against strong pushback, Harris legally worked her way around enforcing the death penalty and she instituted the Back on Track program with less than 10% recidivism rate that is so successful it’s been instituted nationwide. The average was 53% when she entered the office. She had one of the best platforms imo of any candidate on immigration, on maternal healthcare and has always worked to protect California as a sanctuary state. La Opinión endorsed her as VP recognizing this. Contrary to the disinformation campaign against her, she never once threw a single parent in jail for truancy (unlike her predecessors) and instead improved attendance rate for low-income kids by 20%, improving their standards of living, health and further education. She secured $25B from predatory banks for residents in California, cleared the rape kit backlog she inherited, knocked down the gay/trans panic defense and successfully protected sex workers and child sex abuse victims better than any of her predecessors. She was marrying same-sex couples long before it was recognised nationwide, and her fighting Prop 8 in court is one of the reasons same sex marriage was legalized nationally.

You can also read about how difficult it is to get to where Kamala is as a black woman and how unfairly her progressivism [is judged here](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/08/give-kamala-harris-break/615127/)  By sweeping the DA, AG and senate elections in California (the 8th largest economy in the world) all on her first attempts, she is the highest ranking black female elected official ever in the United States and one of the most accomplished black female politicians in the world.  The polls suggest black turnout and Hispanic enthusiasm will be greater with a black woman on the ticket. Why is this important? Because white people haven’t voted a democrat for president since 1964, but black women voted 94% for Hillary Clinton. Black women got Doug Jones an upset victory in Alabama because of their incredible turnout and the fact they universally voted for him. No other group votes like this. Although those of us that did vote in 2016 voted overwhelmingly anti-Trump, she lost partly because turnout among black voters was down sharply. [Bakari Sellers illustrates this point using his mother here.](https://twitter.com/firinglineshow/status/1273284266600755200?s=21) White women were invaluable in flipping the house in 2018: white women support Kamala for VP.

Also, although Biden is polling high, his one issue is enthusiasm. You wouldn’t know from Reddit but Kamala has a dedicated and passionate supporter base mostly on twitter called the KHive, her “joyful warriors” who helped her raise 3.5M for Biden in a recent fundraiser and strongly advocate for her.  Harris has a personal relationship with the Biden family as she was friends with his son Beau (who was AG of Delaware) before he died.

She can contrast Biden’s more amicable tone by switching to her attack dog mode when needed. The Trump campaign is clearly terrified of her and they don’t know how to message against her. She’s whip smart and will be glorious to watch debate Mike Pence.

She votes same as Bernie for almost all budgets, and was always going to vote no on this entire budget where Bernie’s amendment was contained. Bernie wrote a poorly constructed 400 point amendment and she didn’t appreciate the very handwave-y way it re-allocated funds. It is also ridiculous to make this kind of amendment in a year like this. She explains explicitly why she voted against this amendment here: https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-statement-on-ndaa-amendment-vote.  Her statement said:  “I remain supportive of the effort, and am hopeful that with the benefit of additional time, future efforts will more specifically address these complicated issues and earn my enthusiastic support. Congress must finally make smart investments in American communities during this crisis. People across the country are hurting. Parents can’t find work, kids can’t go to school, and sick people can’t afford the health care they need. Now more than ever, we must find ways to reinvest in families and communities, which is why I have introduced the Monthly Economic Crisis Support Act with Senator Sanders and the Saving Our Street Act with Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (D-MA). Congress has a responsibility to do more—much more.”  Note Sherrod Brown and Rand Paul also voted against the amendment and this is a subject of their expertise. Harris almost always votes down Trump’s insane military budgets and this one was no exception. Harris, Warren and Sanders ended up all voting NO as well on the entire budget where this amendment was included, and once again Harris explained why:  “I am thankful for all the work negotiators did to this point, however, I voted no because Californians demand better. I could not vote for a bill that provides backdoor funding for Trump’s border wall, clears a pathway to testing a nuclear weapon for the first time in decades, and does not adequately address the scourge of sexual assault in the military. And I could not back this bill after Republicans refused to include our amendments to demilitarize police departments.”  It really frustrates me that we on the left online denigrate Harris based on whether or not she falls in line with Bernie. She actually has a more progressive voting record than Bernie, a higher rate of passing progressive legislation than Bernie and imo constructs legislation more meticulously than him. It annoys me that people purity test her using him and use no nuance to look at her record.',\n",

       "    'text': 'Claim: There are various versions of the false claims that Kamala Harris: blocked the release of prisoners; kept prisoners locked up for cheap prison labor; kept prisoners locked up for slave labor; refused to address prison overcrowding; kept prisoners locked up to fight fires for cheap. The Real: The false claim arises around one specific court filing by one of the 1,000 attorneys (Patrick McKinney) working for the CA DOJ . The role of the CA AG office is to represent various state agencies in litigation and in this case the state agency was the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The court rejected McKinney’s filing on behalf of the CDCR, therefore prisoners were not in fact kept locked up despite earning 2 for 1 good time credits. Kamala Harris was not involved in the court filing nor aware of the filing prior to a news report. With over 20,000 cases per year in the Civil Law division alone (resulting in exponentially more court filings) it would not have been customary for the Attorney General to be involved in a case that only required the expertise of a mid level Deputy AG III that was several levels of management below the Harris’ level.   Claim: Oversaw a state prosecutor falsifying a confession to get a life sentence and then destroyed the evidence The Real: This claim is in reference to wrongdoing by Deputy District Attorney Robert Murray of Kern County. The Attorney General oversees 4,500 employees including over 1,000 lawyers, but the AG does not supervise local District Attorneys and their deputies. In 2013, prior to trial during plea discussions, ADA Murray admitted to falsifying a translated transcript in the case of Efrain Velasco Palacios who faced 5 counts of lewd and lascivious acts against the 10 year old daughter of his live-in girlfriend. Palacios was facing 8 years for the 5 counts and was not charged with a crime that faced a life sentence. Superior Court Judge Staley threw the case out due to Murray’s misconduct and Palacios’ attorney being removed from the case for allegedly saying his client did not have a viable defense. The judge’s decision was appealed, arguing that Palacios could still get a fair trial with a new counsel. The judge’s decision was upheld on appeal. In 2015, Efrain Velasco Palacios plead no contest to lew or lascivious acts and unlawful intercourse with a 13 year old girl and was sentenced to 4 years in prison.

Vaccines address a shared risk, and although herd immunity is considered an obligation, having a 'personal stake' (not 'back to normal') in this is usually implied. When it comes to influenza for example, I estimate that as little as 10-15% get the vaccine in my country once you subtract the at risk and those in the healthcare sector. In the case of covid, the mortality risk is tiny for under 44's or 55's. So for me, I think the vaccine should be taken individually, and if it's inefficient there are other treatments like ivermectin as a backup.  If our shared risk was long covid then this should have been front and center of the debate. Instead, it's been a marginal issue, addressed most of the time by anecdotes, and not real science, while the mortality statistics are what has been utilized to scare people into doing an experimental medical procedure. In the end, I think if deaths are reduced to normal levels for a virus then society should return to normal, and post viral problems like long covid, while they may be serious, should be not be justification for further lockdowns or society wide medical interventions, but addressed with the appropriate medications for those individuals. I don't doubt your case, but I do still question how many are really suffering because of covid. There are many indications of mental health problems [related](https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/kn2xe4/allindividually,ntal_effects_of_lockdowns_divided/) to the lockdowns, for example. The context here is an organized government campaign to scare people into this world of excessive health security. I note that the protocols being introduced like vaccine passports were planned *[before](https://off-guardian.org/2020/05/22/report-eu-planning-vaccination-passport-since-2018/)* covid, yet covid now seems to be presented as the justification. So there is not just personal risk here but troubling societal implications.\",\n",

       "    'text': '&gt; But the peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is, that it is robbing the human race; posterity as well as the existing generation; those who dissent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it. If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth: if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error. We can never be sure that the opinion we are endeavouring to stifle is a false opinion; and if we were sure, stifling it would be an evil still. The opinion which it is attempted to suppress by authority may possibly be true. Those who desire to suppress it, of course deny its truth; but they are not infallible. They have no authority to decide the question for all mankind, and exclude every other person from the means of judging. To refuse a hearing to an opinion, because they are sure that it is false, is to assume that\\xa0their\\xa0certainty is the same thing as\\xa0absolute\\xa0certainty. All silencing of discussion is an assumption of infallibility. Its condemnation may be allowed to rest on this common argument, not the worse for being common. Unfortunately for the good sense of mankind, the fact of their fallibility is far from carrying the weight in their practical judgment, which is always allowed to it in theory; for while every one well knows himself to be fallible, few think it necessary to take any precautions against their own fallibility, or admit the supposition that any opinion, of which they feel very certain, may be one of the examples of the error to which they acknowledge themselves to be liable. -- John Stuart Mill',\n",

It is clear from the graph that this average is a significant underestimate. It actually corresponds to the death rate in 2017. It is even much less than the value in 2019 (8.782). To say that the projected death rate in 2020 (without COVID-19), is less than it was in 2019, given the obvious upward trend, is absurd. The CDC authors admit to all the possible sources of error and to the fact that results vary based on different methods of calculation. They are not naïve. Nevertheless, their analysis is seriously biased.  This bias alone makes the CDC excess mortality 198,801.  Based on the linear projection, the excess mortality for the analysis period is 127,835 – much lower.\",\n",

Not physically forcing of course but it's social pressure, which is affecting someones ability to make a free and informed decision.   You're right about college, not that I agree with that (and the context for those vaccines is different). In regards to employment, I am saying that if any job can decide for themselves to require the vaccine in an environment of widespread societal pressure it could lead to a discriminatory society. Compulsary vaccination in the workplace is usually limited to certain sectors.   It's not reasonable to pressure other people undergo medical procedures by limiting their quality of life because your vaccines are not sufficiently protecting you. If you take a medication, you sign up to the risk associated with it, and so does anyone else who takes that particular treatment.\",\n",

I\\'m not sure about this, I would expect that not being put at a disadvantage implies that someone is not already put a disadvantage. I don\\'t see any warning that \"you may be put at a disadvantage prior to consenting\".  &gt; That\\'s neither here nor there, since the UNESCO committee that drafted the declaration further explains  Firstly, covid is definitely nothing at all whatsover like the black plague, contrary to what some people seem to believe. It doesn\\'t even affect most of the population, which is why the restrictions have elicited so much controversy and opposition. As to the rather vaguely stated limitations, I think a two tier checkpoint medical apartheid society is excessive, divisive and dangerous to society, and pointless, since the at risk groups are vaccinated.  To me, the idea of an indiscriminate \\'compulsary vaccination\\' for a group which doesn\\'t necessarily even share a risk of death from the disease, is conceptually absurd. If people are truly in danger, they will be incentivized by the danger itself to take the medication, since in today\\'s world we can actually observe the data ourselves. But yeah I see now it\\'s probably not the best quote to use, you are right on that. These people propose criminalizing medical decisions, based on centuries old scenarios for something that to my mind doesn\\'t even really make any sense. I can\\'t say I\\'m surprised that lawyers, philosophers and other so-called proponents of justice and fairness take such a position.  As to the pregnancy thing, you seem to be suggesting that time off work or a woman\\'s own guilt about taking substances affects the choice to terminate her pregnancy. The gravity of the situation seems different here, because these changes seem necessary (from her point of view), deserved, and not actually a contributing factor in a decision...',\n",

So the phrase “enemy of the people” was first used by the senate to describe Nero in Ancient Rome. It gained common usage to describe those who disagreed with the government in France during the period known as “The Reign of Terror”.   It was then used in a play written by Henrik Ibsen, and it was then used by the Nazis.   It had its widest usage by Joseph Stalin and Vladimir Lenin in Soviet Russia.   ——  In more recent years it was used by a hand full of world leaders including, but not limited to: Hugo Chavez used it to shut down an opposing television channel, Nixon, Putin, again to attack a news channel.   ——  And just a weird thing: the only odd one out of this list would be Thomas Jefferson, and was telling the people they couldn’t trust the press, but he and his successor president James Madison had set up their own gazette to slander his election opponent president John Adams.  ——————— https://www.businessinsider.com/history-of-president-trumps-phrase-an-enemy-of-the-people-2017-2  https://www.indy100.com/article/donald-trump-president-press-enemies-people-twitter-tweet-7586866',\n",

It\\'s true that hospitals get extra funding for COVID cases, but there isn\\'t any single bit of hard data suggesting a number of faked cases that might be happening. It\\'s just someone going \"This might be happening probably\" and people running with it because it helps them reinforce what they want to believe.   There are also people saying that victims aren\\'t dying of COVID, they just HAVE COVID, and are dying of other things, like obesity, or diabetes, or pneumonia. But again, there\\'s no accounting for the fact that these people were NOT dying, and were living with their conditions before catching the virus.   The people you\\'re referring to are pretty much universally going off of the basis that it might make sense to them that some people might be lying, therefore most of it is fake.

For starters, the bailout of the auto industry started in the waning weeks of President George W. Bush’s tenure. It continued during the early months of the Obama administration.  &gt;All told, the Treasury Department reported that the program cost taxpayers $79.7 billion, of which $70.4 billion was recovered. Under that estimate, the program lost about $9.3 billion. In April, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the program would end up costing about $14 billion.  https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/22/barack-obama/obama-says-automakers-have-paid-back-all-loans-it-/',\n",

The Kremlin hopes to achieve this through meddling in European and American politics so as to install governments acquiescent to it’s primary objective: supplanting the values-driven, rules-based international system with what Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov recently called a “post-Western world order” wherein might makes right. In this order, Russia’s neighbors will have to accept limited sovereignty within a Russian sphere of influence.  &gt;Moscow seeks nothing less than a reversal of the momentous historical processes begun in 1989, when Central and Eastern Europeans peacefully reclaimed their freedom after decades of Russian-imposed tyranny. For President Vladimir Putin, who witnessed the downfall of Russia’s empire as a KGB officer stationed in East Germany, and for whom the Soviet Union’s collapse was “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century,” this revulsion for everything that 1989 represents is deeply felt. Putin is implacably hostile to the United States, blaming it for bringing down the Soviet empire and humiliating Russia. Because the European Union and NATO – both of which have welcomed countries once dominated by Russia – serve as obstacles to the reassertion of Russian hegemony, Moscow’s long-term strategy is to undermine and ultimately break these institutions from within, thereby neutralizing the concert of nations that has traditionally been necessary to restrain Russian expansion on the Continent. The Kremlin’s ideal outcome is the “Finlandization” of the West, whereby Europe and America abandon their principles, sacrifice their allies and accommodate Kremlin prerogatives without Russia having to dispatch a single soldier abroad. A West that is divided, inert and unsure of its own basic values is not one that will resist Russia’s revisionist agenda.

Even if the election comes down in the 100% best case scenario, we are still *extremely* fucked, with almost every institution that we rely on in tatters, and 2/5 of the country willing to die to prevent anybody from fixing them.\",\n",

They had a plan that Trump's cronies in the military would block the National Guard from helping.  They had a plan to overthrow a branch of the government and either didn't care or hoped people would die.  These are some of the worst criminals in American history and incompetence is the only reason it wasn't a lot worse.

       "    'text': \"As mayor of Newark, Cory Booker joined Betsy DeVos on the board of Alliance for School Choice, which advocated using taxpayer dollars for charter, private and religious schools.  &gt;[He appeared at the May 2016 policy summit of DeVos’s American Federation for Children, which he called “an incredible organization,” and he urged the attendees to “stay faithful to the work we are doing.”](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/01/21/democrats-reject-her-but-they-helped-pave-the-road-to-education-nominee-devos/) this is from WaPo  And from [NPR Fresh Air with Terry Gross](https://www.npr.org/2015/09/21/442183080/assessing-the-100-million-upheaval-of-newarks-public-schools)  &gt;GROSS: So Cory Booker takes the Zuckerberg money and creates a local foundation to handle the Zuckerberg gift and the matching donations. It's called Foundation for Newark's Future. But you're right that the seats on this foundation went only to donors who gave $10 million or more. That was later reduced to $5 million or more, which meant that virtually no one from Newark could afford to serve on this foundation that was trying to change the Newark schools. How did that play in the community?  &gt;&gt;RUSSAKOFF: Well, that was again totally alienating of the community because there were a number of local foundations in Newark that had been involved for years in education. And, you know, $5 million as an annual gift just was not in their budget. And so they were excluded from having any say, but more importantly, there was no way for the parents, the teachers, the principals, the community leaders - just, you know, really, really intelligence, smart, committed people who had been in the fray for years in the lives of children in education - to be part of this. And so basically, the board decided to spend the money the way the wealthy donors wanted it spent. And the priorities were not about getting money to the classroom or to the children. The priorities were to have to this kind of business model, top-down reform that had become very popular in the reform movement.  &gt;GROSS: One of the criticisms of how the money was handled was that $20 million went to consultants, and a lot of the consultants were paid, like, a thousand dollars a day. And you compare that to what teachers make in a year, and that what was their response to that?\",\n",

Money spent on war is egregious, but they don\\'t want to actually reduce it. And so on.  This.

It was VERY far from the abstract viewpoint we can so easily lay over slavery today. Of course we know it\\'s evil today... but many of the founders knew it than.  The issue was, in many areas, slaves were over half the population... releasing literally millions of people from shackles, without knowing their response to the injustice, was a dangerous direction in the birth of a new nation. The founders were EXTREMELY calculated about the subject, and for good reason. They weren\\'t all a bunch of dolts that wrote the words with slaves at home.  Slavery was an enduring institution for thousands of years, and was far from a simple thing to alter... the founders knew that well, and treaded lightly. We likely wouldn\\'t be here in this form, if they had simply abolished slavery on day one. It\\'s an unfortunate truth, that it was easier to start slavery than to stop it.  Many of the founders held their slaves as more like family members, and protected their interests, knowing the situation they were in.. and being legally unable to free them at the time.  The hardline abolitionists were the extremists of their time, as they didn\\'t consider the repercussions to the nation of instantaneously abolishing slavery.',\n",

My written expert opinion regarding Michelle Cedillo was not intended to be a blanket statement as to all children and all medical science.  8.

I have reviewed extensive genetic, metabolic and other medical records of William \"Yates\" Hazlehurst. In my opinion, and to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, Yates Hazlehurst suffered regressive encephalopathy with features of autism spectrum disorder as a result of a vaccine injury in the same manner as described in the DOJ concession in Poling v. H.H.S., with additional factors that Yates Hazlehurst was vaccinated while ill, administered antibiotics and after previously suffering from symptoms consistent with a severe adverse vaccine reaction.  &amp;#x200B;  18. I have reviewed the attached portion of the transcript, of Vincent Matanoski\\'s closing argument in Hazlehurst v. H.H.S., which is attached as Exhibit D. The relevant portion of the transcript states as follows:   &gt;I did want to mention one thing about an expert, who did not appear here, but his name has been mentioned several times, and that was Dr. Zimmerman. Dr. Zimmerman actually has not appeared here, but he has given evidence on this issue, and it appear in the Cedillo case. I just wanted to read briefly because his name was mentioned several times by Petitioners in this matter. What his views were on these theories, and I\\'m going to quote from Respondent\\'s Exhibit FF in the Cedillo case, which is part of the record in this case as I understand it.   &gt;   &gt;There is no scientific basis for a connection between measles, mumps and rubella MMR vaccine or mercury intoxication in    &gt;   &gt;autism despite well-intentioned and thoughtful hypotheses and widespread beliefs about apparent connection with autism and    &gt;   &gt;regression. There\\'s no sound evidence to support a causative relationship with exposure to both or either MMR and/or mercury.   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;We know his views on this issue.  19. In my opinion, the statement by Mr. Matonoski during his closing argument regarding my expert opinion was highly misleading and not an accurate reflection of my opinion for two reasons. First, Mr. Matanoski took portions of my opinion out of context. My opinion as to Michelle Cedillo was case specific. I was only referring to the medical evidence that I had reviewed regarding her. My opinion regarding Michelle Cedillo was not intended to be a blanket statement as to all children and all medical science. Second, as explained above, I specifically explained to Mr. Matanoski and other DOJ attorneys who were present that there were exceptions in which vaccinations could cause autism.',\n",

You've presented no cohesive argument other than an assumption of my education level and some generalized statements. You say there is no link between autism and vaccines, but you linked a study which only looks at the MMR. Provide me some studies that look at a possible link between DTap and Autism, DTP and autism, hep-b, or any of the other vaccines on the schedule other than the MMR. I'll be waiting for awhile, they do not exist. Only the MMR has been studied in relation to autism, along with thimerosal. Many parents have reported regression after many of these vaccines, not just the MMR.   &amp;#x200B;  The study you linked is the study I mentioned in my first comment. There are a few problems with the study:  1. Variant rate of autism between the cohort and the population of Denmark. The studies rate is .9-1. Denmark's rate of autism is 1.65. Why is there a difference between the 600k children in the study, and the national rate of autism of Denmark? 2. It is a comparison of fully vaccinated children with the MMR, and fully vaccinated children that haven't received the MMR yet. The argument against vaccines is the adjuvant alum being used in almost all of them. This study protocol is the equivalent of comparing 6 shots of vodka vs 6 shots of vodka and 1 shot of whiskey. 3. Denmark's vaccine schedule is much smaller than the CDC schedule. Many vaccines are left out, such as the Hep B at birth, varicella, and the yearly flu shot. That is a wide variation in how many thousands of micrograms of alum and other chemicals are injected into the human body.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;\",\n",

       "    'text': 'The evidence is a-plenty. Read some books by people who put all this research together, and follow their sources to the studies online. Those both for and against vaccines.  Let\\'s talk about vaccines and autism though. Everything I state below can be confirmed if you do your research. Not even that hard to do.  To  start off, out of the 16+ vaccines on the schedule and the 38  ingredients in those vaccines, how many of those 16 vaccines and 38  ingredients have been studied in connection with autism? The answer is 2 vaccines, 1 ingredient.  &amp;#x200B;  The  first study that \"disproved the link between vaccines and autism\" is  the Verstraeten study.   This study was epidemiological (meaning they  graphed data and looked for statistically significant correlations).  They compared two groups of children and wanted to see if thimerisol had  a neurological effect (autism symptoms) in children. One group had been injected with  80mcg of thimerisol over their lifetime, the other 130mcg.   The studies  CONCLUSION: We can neither prove nor disprove a connection between  thimerisol and autism. More research needs to be done.  If  you know what the golden standard is (control group, placebo group),  then you should clearly see the issue with this study. If you don\\'t, let me explain it this way:   This study is the equivalent of comparing people who smoke 1 pack of cigs a day to a group of people who smoke 2 packs a day, and concluding that they could neither confirm nor deny a connection between cigarettes and cancer.  Interestingly  enough, they did prove a statistical association with tics and  thimerisol (mercury). Tics are found in over 30% of children with  autism.  &amp;#x200B;  This study was taken up by the media and literally called the \"study that disproves link between vaccines and autism\".  The  kicker about the above article? The main author Dr. Verstraeten wrote a  letter to the journal (Pediatrics) that published his study and said I quote   \"Surprisingly, however, the study is being interpreted now as negative  (meaning no association proven) by many....The article does not state  that we found evidence against an association, as a negative study  would. It does state, that additional study is recommended.....A neutral  study carries a very distinct message: the investigators could neither  confirm nor exclude an association, and therefore more study is  required.\"  &amp;#x200B;  In  conclusion, there are a total of 21 studies put forth by the CDC and  Big Pharma which disprove the link between vaccines and autism. 17 of  them are epidemiological, 4 are meta studies of the 17. All 21 studies  focus on 2 vaccines, and 1 ingredient. The 17 studies all share similar  issues similar to the study I have described above.  &amp;#x200B;  Again, that still leaves 37 ingredients and 14+ vaccines that have never been studied in connection with autism.  By the way, one of the main studies, the MMR Autism study of 2004 has a whistleblower named Dr. William Thompson stating he and his 4 associates on this study falsified data and committed medical fraud by misrepresenting the data they found in their study.   He released this statement through a whistleblower lawyer, and is still waiting to be deposed by Congress. Still hasn\\'t happened....',\n",

I\\'ll try to explain it in a simple way.  The MMR vaccine is far from the only vaccine blamed for adverse events which caused children to lose previously learned language, skills, ability to walk, etc. Children have had seizures, brain encephalitis, high fevers, and other reactions from all vaccines.  In some cases the adverse events are caused by the cumulative effect of multiple vaccines over a child\\'s life span. Some people are genetically incapable or slow at clearing out toxins from their systems (MTFHR gene). Those toxins eventually add up, and cause any number of diseases or issues.  So a study comparing kids who got 50 shots to kids that got 51 shots is hardly proof of anything. Plus the study had a number of issues which got called out by numerous scientists.',\n",

       "    'text': 'It is great that you are being objective and walking the middle of the road, but by your written opinion it is clear you have not done your due diligence on this subject. Autism has conclusively been proven to be caused by an immune activation event in the brain, and many things can cause that event. I don\\'t have a link to the study since I\\'m not on my home computer. The \"genetic\" theory has had billions of dollars of research thrown at it with no results, except a common gene found in those with autism. As most people like to spew out the silly rhetoric without any understanding behind it, \"correlation does not equal causation\".  \"Harsh\" chemicals being better handled by a full grown adult is true, but that isn\\'t the debate. The debate is not about whether vaccines work or don\\'t, and it\\'s not about whether we should be giving them to people or not.   If you managed to sift through all the misinformation, misdirection, propaganda and stupidity of the internet, you\\'d see the core of the issue is the safety testing behind vaccines. To put it into perspective, Viagra went through a 10 year safety study that included double blind, inactive placebo control group. The Hep-B vaccine went through a 4 day and 5 day safety study. There was no control group, and the subjects were not monitored past the 4 and 5 day mark. It is silly to think that serious side effects were properly monitored for and captured in 2 safety studies less than a week long.  The studies done by the pharmaceutical companies and government regulatory agencies have many flaws, namely not following the golden standard required for all other drugs, which is double blind placebo. There is a large amount of independent studies that show vastly conflicting, worrisome results but they don\\'t get the same PR spin as those funded by Merck, GSK, and the CDC. To hear about those studies, to listen to the experts doing those studies, one has to actively seek \"anti-vaccine\" information. Most do not do that.',\n",

       "    'text': 'I know this post is old, but I\\'m going to address your comments on studies with autism links.     The  evidence is a-plenty. Read some books by people who put all this  research together, and follow their sources to the studies online. Those  both for and against vaccines.  Let\\'s  talk about vaccines and autism though. Everything I state below can be  confirmed if you do your research. Not even that hard to do.  To   start off, out of the 16+ vaccines on the schedule and the 38   ingredients in those vaccines, how many of those 16 vaccines and 38   ingredients have been studied in connection with autism? The answer is 2  vaccines, 1 ingredient.  The  first study that \"disproved the link between vaccines and autism\" is  the Verstraeten study.  This  study was epidemiological (meaning they  graphed data and looked for  statistically significant correlations).  They compared two groups of  children and wanted to see if thimerisol had  a neurological effect  (autism symptoms) in children. One group had been injected with  80mcg  of thimerisol over their lifetime, the other 130mcg.  The  studies  CONCLUSION: We can neither prove nor disprove a connection  between  thimerisol and autism. More research needs to be done.  If   you know what the golden standard is (control group, placebo group),   then you should clearly see the issue with this study. If you don\\'t, let  me explain it this way:  This study is  the equivalent of comparing people who smoke 1 pack of cigs a day to a  group of people who smoke 2 packs a day, and concluding that they could  neither confirm nor deny a connection between cigarettes and cancer.  Interestingly   enough, they did prove a statistical association with tics and   thimerisol (mercury). Tics are found in over 30% of children with   autism.  This study was taken up by the media and literally called the \"study that disproves link between vaccines and autism\".  The   kicker about the above article? The main author Dr. Verstraeten wrote a   letter to the journal (Pediatrics) that published his study and said I  quote  \"Surprisingly, however, the study  is being interpreted now as negative  (meaning no association proven)  by many....The article does not state  that we found evidence against an  association, as a negative study  would. It does state, that additional  study is recommended.....A neutral  study carries a very distinct  message: the investigators could neither  confirm nor exclude an  association, and therefore more study is  required.\"  In   conclusion, there are a total of 21 studies put forth by the CDC and   Big Pharma which disprove the link between vaccines and autism. 17 of   them are epidemiological, 4 are meta studies of the 17. All 21 studies   focus on 2 vaccines, and 1 ingredient. The 17 studies all share similar   issues similar to the study I have described above.  Again, that still leaves 37 ingredients and 14+ vaccines that have never been studied in connection with autism.  By  the way, one of the main studies, the MMR Autism study of 2004 has a  whistleblower named Dr. William Thompson stating he and his 4 associates  on this study falsified data and committed medical fraud by  misrepresenting the data they found in their study.  He  released this statement through a whistleblower lawyer, and is still  waiting to be deposed by Congress. Still hasn\\'t happened....  &amp;#x200B;',\n",

Eleven percent of the adult citizen population in the [2000 Census](https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t31/tables/tab01-01.pdf) amounts to 21 million Americans.   &gt;   &gt;The Brennan Center survey also found that black Americans were less likely to have a current government photo ID – 25 percent lacked one, compared to 8 percent of white Americans, with an 8 percent margin of error. It also indicated that 16 percent of Hispanics lacked one, but the results were not statistically significant due to a low sample size.   &gt;   &gt;Other national surveys have similarly found that millions of Americans don’t have government-issued photo ID.   &gt;   &gt;The [American National Election Studies](https://electionstudies.org/) (ANES), a collaboration between Stanford University and the University of Michigan, asked 4,271 respondents in a [2016 time series study](https://www.electionstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/anes_timeseries_2016_userguidecodebook.pdf) if they have a driver’s license, passport or another form of government photo ID. About 3.3\\xa0percent of respondents said they did not have any of these forms of government ID.   &gt;   &gt;Matthew DeBell, a senior research scholar for ANES, told The Daily Caller News Foundation in an email that, including a margin of error, the results could be summarized as, “In the study population of about 224 million, there are about 6 to 9 million adult U.S. citizens who don’t have ID.”   &gt;   &gt;Another survey, the [Survey of the Performance of American Elections](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/Y38VIQ) (SPAE), focused on registered voters rather than the total adult citizen population. It asked about more specific forms of government-issued ID like military IDs and IDs from state colleges. The 2016 SPAE surveyed 10,200 voters, 200 in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia.   &gt;   &gt;The SPAE does not publicly list composite results of voters who had at least one form of government-issued photo ID, but Charles Stewart III, a political science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who conducted the survey, provided TheDCNF with weighted calculations.   &gt;   &gt;About 96.6 percent had at least one photo ID in the form of a driver’s license, passport, public assistance ID, military ID, Native American ID, ID from an in-state college, firearm license, or an ID from a federal, state or local agency, while 3.4 percent either did not have one of those forms of ID, did not provide a response or did not know.   &gt;   &gt;The Census Bureau [estimated](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/voting-and-registration/p20-580.html) that 157.6 million people were registered to vote for the 2016 election. Stewart’s 3.4 percent figure applied to the Census estimate would amount to 5.4 million people (though that includes 0.7 percent of people who weren’t sure if they had a driver’s license, 0.9 percent who weren’t sure if they had a passport and less than 0.5 percent who did not respond about the other forms – a composite number was not available).\"  As for the reasons they don\\'t have an I.D, they largely boil down to:  * Cost * Travel * Missing Required Documents (which feeds into the first two)  So look, as someone from the Left, here is your opportunity right side to meet in the middle. You want to require I.Ds? Fine, but you also have to provide/create a system in which everyone who wants an I.D, can get one. That might mean making them free for certain people, helping them get documents they need, having better hours, or going out to people\\'s homes out in the boonies and sorting it out. But if a citizen wants an I.D to vote, they should be able to get it. There are already charities/organizations that do exactly this so surely it can be worked out on a grander scale.',\n",

       "    'text': \"I just want you to reread that:  &gt;Government programs like\\xa0Medicare\\xa0and\\xa0Medicaid\\xa0have increased overall demand for medical services—resulting in higher prices as well. What's more, increases in the incidence of chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, especially among seniors, have had a direct impact on increases in the cost of medical care. Chronic diseases constitute 85% of healthcare costs, and more than half of all Americans have\\xa0a chronic illness.  Cost has gone up, because demand has gone up because people are actually getting medical care since these were introduced. Its not because of the policies of the programs themselves, its because of the program's existence enabling more people to get care who otherwise wouldn't. I'm not sure what the counterpoint could be to this and seems inevitable outside of simply not offering health care which seems like a horrible option.  &gt;Again, it is arguably contributing to rising healthcare costs. When combined with other factors, i.e. healthcare providers costs, insurance agreements,, a growing population, aging population, and population with chronic health conditions (sometimes being by choice via unhealthy lifestyles) it is part of the equation for rising costs.  Part of the equation sure, but you present it as if it is the issue is medicare itself, not what its being used for like the article you linked points out, chronic disease. If the issue when it comes to healthcare cost is its use, and most of its use comes from chronic diseases (and an older population), wouldn't it seem to be prudent to have a system that promotes preventing chronic diseases in the first place? Because taking a quick look at some health statistics, it looks like that issue is only getting worse and worse when it comes to the US. That doesn't say to me that this is medicare's fault, that tells me the issue is when people finally get to use medicare they have all these chronic conditions at that point that are expensive to maintain.  &gt;Combine that with a lax immigration policy (all legal immigration should be welcome, but cutting in line ahead of legal immigrants by illegal immigrants should be stopped, not encouraged) you can see how subsidized universal healthcare can be a very bad thing for prosperity to the average American by way of footing the huge collective tax bill.  But we are footing the bill right now, per the article you linked, due to an aging population &amp; chronic conditions. Currently, 6/10 Americans have a chronic condition, so what if you could bring that number down to 5/10 or 4/10? How much would that bring costs down? And what would it cost to achieve that? Because that, per the article you linked, is 85% of healthcare costs, so it seems to me if you brought that down, you would actually see a reduction in spending AND maintain healthcare for people, as opposed to kicking people off so they don't have the insurance to be counted as a statistic.  Its do you want to pay $10 now, or $100 later? One only needs to take a look at what is happening in Texas to see that paying the $10 years ago likely would have been the better option.\",\n",

In addition, the person shall be liable for all damages to person or property by reason of the same.

People won\\'t know of a cause until they are made aware of it, and they won\\'t be made aware of it until it\\'s somehow newsworthy.

The necessity of unanimity in public bodies, or of something approaching towards it, has been founded upon a supposition that it would contribute to security. But its real operation is to embarrass the administration, to destroy the energy of the government, and to substitute the pleasure, caprice, or artifices of an insignificant, turbulent, or corrupt junto, to the regular deliberations and decisions of a respectable majority. In those emergencies of a nation, in which the goodness or badness, the weakness or strength of its government, is of the greatest importance, there is commonly a necessity for action. The public business must, in some way or other, go forward. If a pertinacious minority can control the opinion of a majority, respecting the best mode of conducting it, the majority, in order that something may be done, must conform to the views of the minority; and thus the sense of the smaller number will overrule that of the greater, and give a tone to the national proceedings. Hence, tedious delays; continual negotiation and intrigue; contemptible compromises of the public good. And yet, in such a system, it is even happy when such compromises can take place: for upon some occasions things will not admit of accommodation; and then the measures of government must be injuriously suspended, or fatally defeated. It is often, by the impracticability of obtaining the concurrence of the necessary number of votes, kept in a state of inaction. Its situation must always savor of weakness, sometimes border upon anarchy.”   \\\\-  *Federalist* No. 22',\n",

Products are not going to raise their prices by 50%.  &gt;In a new Upjohn Institute [working paper](http://research.upjohn.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1278&amp;context=up_workingpapers), Daniel MacDonald and Eric Nilsson, of California State University, Bernardino, advance the literature on price effects of minimum wage increases.   &gt;   &gt;Historically, minimum wage increases were large, one-shot changes imposed with little advance notice for businesses. But many recent state and city-level minimum wage increases have been scheduled to be implemented over time and often are indexed to some measure of price inflation. These small, scheduled minimum wage hikes seem to have smaller effects on prices than large, one-time increases.   &gt;   &gt;By looking at changes in restaurant food pricing during the period of 1978–2015, MacDonald and Nilsson find that prices rose by just 0.36 percent for every 10 percent increase in the minimum wage, which is only about half the size reported in previous studies. They also observe that small minimum wage increases do not lead to higher prices and may actually reduce prices. Furthermore, it is also possible that small minimum wage increases could lead to increased employment in low-wage labor markets.  The issue is we haven't been making these small corrections, but large giant ones which create these shocks to the system. At some point, that correct is needed to be made, but if we continually make smaller ones afterward then it's far more beneficial. If the minimum wage was raised to the highest point in its history spending power and adjusted for inflation for today, it would be $12.10 right now.\",\n",

       "    'text': '&gt;Michael Flynn.  Only two [indictments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment) have ever been handed down under the Logan Act. The first occurred in 1803 when a [grand jury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury) indicted Francis Flournoy, a Kentucky farmer, who had written an article in the [*Frankfort*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfort,_Kentucky) *Guardian of Freedom* under the [pen name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen_name) of \"A Western American.\" In the article, Flournoy advocated for the creation of a new independent state, not part of the US, in North America that would ally with France. The [United States Attorney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney) for Kentucky, an Adams appointee and brother-in-law of Chief Justice [John Marshall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Marshall), went no further than procuring the indictment of Flournoy, and there was no further [prosecution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor) of the Kentucky farmer. The [purchase of the Louisiana Territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase) later that year appeared to cause the separatism issue to become moot, and the case was abandoned.[\\\\[2\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Act#cite_note-Seitzinger-2)[\\\\[10\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Act#cite_note-10)  In 1852, [Jonas Phillips Levy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Phillips_Levy) became the second and, to date the last, person to be indicted under the Logan Act. Levy, an American merchant and sailor who was living in [Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Federal_Republic_of_Mexico) at the time, had acquired a grant to build a railway across the [Isthmus of Tehuantepec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isthmus_of_Tehuantepec), the narrowest point across Mexico. Secretary of State [Daniel Webster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Webster) had been pressuring Mexico to accept a treaty that would allow a different group of American businessmen to build the railway. Levy wrote a letter to [Mexican President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Mexico) [Mariano Arista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariano_Arista) urging him to reject Webster\\'s proposed treaty, prompting Webster to seek an indictment against Levy for violating the Logan Act. Federal prosecutors were forced to dismiss the case after Arista refused to hand over the original copy of the letter, depriving them of the evidence they needed to convict Levy.[\\\\[3\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Act#cite_note-duda2017-3)',\n",

A quick shortlist would be :  * Better hours at the DMV (more evenings, weekends). * Provide IDs for free for those who can't afford them, as well as other documents needed to obtain an ID. * Have services to help those where distance is an issue (elderly, poor)and actively reach out to those who don't have an ID. * Ease the process of getting the documents needed to get an ID. * Provide everyone in the Public School System their first I.D as part of Driver's Ed  This would solve most if not all the problems of those who are poor, elderly, disabled, live far away, or any combination of them. The funny thing is, many states have one or two of these already, it's just bringing them all together in a unified way. Do this, and you get support on the left for this.

Its betting at the end of the day, your betting on more people wanting said stock, so it rises in value, and you can then sell that stock to turn a profit.

Definitely most people in business here hate him; his tariffs and his general mannerisms really put off people with any oilfield and manufacturing stakes. He\\'s a joke in the two urban centers of Edmonton &amp; Calgary. From my admittedly low viewing of rural Alberta, most people dont like him as well. There is a subset of poorly educated confederate flag types that everyone has always kind of scoffed at that like him, I\\'d put it around 20% of the population tops that doesn\\'t abhor him.  Folks here definitely hate Trudeau though. Mostly due to sins of the father; Pierre\\'s economic plans caused undue hardship in this province and he\\'s never been forgiven. During the late 70s / early 80\\'s energy boom, he created the NEP (national energy program) which defined the minimum and maximum price Oil products could be sold at. More or less robbing all of Alberta to make sure Ontario and Quebec didn\\'t have to worry about larger energy bills. During the worlds biggest Oil boom, Alberta the Oil province, set an all time record for job loss, unemployment, bankruptcy, and loan delinquency. Right after, when the price of Oil crashed again, Trudeau Senior repealed his program when it would potentially benefit Alberta. People in Alberta, and all of Western Canada for that matter, really did not like any of this at all.  The NEP was considered by Albertans to be among the most unfair federal policies ever implemented. Scholars calculated the program cost Alberta between $50- and $100-billion in the 80s. Western Canadian\\'s felt like second class citizens, there were riots, people phoning in talking about overthrowing the crown. This all culminated in [Trudeau Senior literally giving people in Western Canada the finger](https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/a-b-c-museum-says-its-preserved-the-railcar-from-which-pierre-trudeau-gave-the-finger-to-protesters).

It is a popular idea among those who are quite wealthy and wish to skip triage lines, and I think the thought is a hybridization more than a strict privatization, but I think more than anything the idea is a \"quiet part\" that doesn\\'t get said out loud to make the rich donors happy.',\n",

       "    'text': 'Well, the way healthcare in Canada works, especially with respects to \"essential\" healthcare services, is that it\\'s not really government insurance so much as it\\'s government hospitals.  It acts as an insurance with less essential services, but say if you get cancer, your treatment options are all government run from ground up.  There is supplemental third party insurance, often pays for prescriptions, and more luxury medical services like massages and the like. But if you find a lump and are worried about cancer, or are getting a general check up, or want physiotherapy after a car accident etc, it\\'s all government run. There are third party clinics for certain things, but usually it\\'s fairly specific and less expensive or elective type situations. For example through work I have 100% prescription drug coverage up to 15k per year, then 80% coverage after that, as well as 1.5k per year in dental, and about ten other kits of a few hundred bucks for various paramedical expenses. But you can\\'t get like an alternate primary care network; only the single care network exists.  Here in my city for example we have 6 major hospitals, and they are all owned by the province. But there are lots of private practice dentists, GPs, eye doctors, plastic surgeons, etc ... But it\\'s not like in the States where you can just go to one of those, you have to go through the government service to get transferred to the third party service. If that makes sense.  Personally, I would prefer that healthcare stays fully public, but I wouldn\\'t be opposed to private options being available so long as all the capital for these options is not government funded and doesn\\'t detract from the quality of service and care of the public option.

US States each (individually) have their own rules about time-frames and when things get counted. For example, Colorado (where I am) can start tabulating Mail-in ballots up to 2-weeks PRIOR to Election Day. Some other US States have Laws that say in-person votes have to be counted 1st, and mail-in or dropped off ballots get counted afterwards. (why they make those rules.. I have no idea)  You also have to remember that State/County often are under-budgeted and under-staffed.. so the speed at which they can do things is limited. I've been peripherally involved in some City Elections before and I've seen people go 24hours without sleep just working straight through because they understand the importance of it.

Still, scientists have been divided on the implications of some of the mutations. Some experts have reported that the D614G variation has made the virus more transmissible, however other studies have contradicted that.\"  &gt; \"Either way, the changes so far have not resulted in strains that would likely be resistant to vaccines in development. In fact, one study by a group of scientists from several institutions including the University of Sheffield and Harvard University found that G strains might present an easier target for a vaccine because these strains have more spike proteins on their surface, which are the target of vaccine-induced antibodies.\"  &gt; “Fortunately, we found that none of these mutations are making COVID-19 spread more rapidly, but we need to remain vigilant and continue monitoring new mutations, particularly as vaccines get rolled out,” said University College of London Genetics Institute researcher Lucy van Dorp, co-author of a study that identified more than 12,700 mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\"  &gt; \"Still, experts who have watched influenza and HIV mutate over years, evading vaccines, warn that future mutations of SARS-CoV-2 remain unknown. And the best shot at avoiding changes that make the virus impervious to a vaccine remains curtailing its spread and reducing the opportunities it has to mutate.\"  &gt; “If the virus changes substantially, particularly the spike proteins, then it might escape a vaccine. We want to slow transmission globally to slow the clock,” said Deakin’s Bennett. “That reduces the chances of a one in a squillion change that’s awful news for us.”',\n",

       "    'text': '&gt; trying to entangle the debate in terminology arcana  The problem though is:.. Terminology matters.   As many people (myself included) have observed... it\\'s not realistic to \"ban all guns\". It\\'s just not. There\\'s not enough man-power to do so (go home to home collecting guns).. and even if there was, you\\'d need people\\'s cooperation, which (to some %) you\\'re absolutely NOT going to get.   There\\'s already close to 400,000 guns across the USA. How would you realistically ban those ? Even if you start by banning manufacturing/sales.. it would still take decades to track down all those guns (even assuming you got people\\'s cooperation). Buy-back/Trade-in programs in other countries typically only have about a 2/3rd success rate. Would you even get that in the USA?.. Unlikely. That still leaves 100,000+ guns unaccounted for. (and the moment you start trying to collect all of them - -you\\'d spark such a emotionally reaction, the amount of resistance would amp up quite quickly).   So even just a simple logistical level (leaving Politics completely out of it).. just at a simple logistical / physical level.. \"banning all guns\" is pretty much a non-starter.   &gt; \"so the public resolve will only get stronger.\"  The public needs to start working on FACTS and not their media-driven emotional-responses. The reality is.. your odds of being killed in a mass shooting are 32nd down on the list of things that might kill you. (source: https://www.businessinsider.com/mass-shooting-gun-statistics-2018-2) ... so where\\'s the outrage about things that are 100x to 1000x more likely to kill you?.. .  Of course we can (and should) be working on all those things. But our best investment of dollars/time/resources -- would be to work on the things that are 100x to 1000x more likely to kill you. Banning Guns may (or may not) save some lives,. but that same amount of effort put into suicide-prevention or better nutrition or procedures to fix coronary-heart-disease would save 100x to 1000x more lives.

       "    'text': '&gt; So this would bring it down to about 1 gun per 3000 people on average? Hell, why not do this.  My own personal opinion,..   * It\\'s not really the right way to go about it.. because you\\'re \"treating the symptom\" without doing anything to actually fix the underlying problems (issues of mental-health, etc). It\\'s the \"appearance of a solution\" ... even though you\\'re not really solving anything.   * As you try to do it... the civil-unrest and controversy.. is likely to cause more problems than it fixes.   * the deeper you get into it.. you\\'re basically isolating/reducing the problem down to more and more unstable people (IE = the cooperative people will easily give up their guns early.. and the more and more radical will hold out till last) .. so the further you get into it. .the higher and higher chances of \"Waco-type\" scenarios keep rising.   * On top of the fact that there\\'s really no way to do this without eliminating the 2nd Amendment and/or eliminating what\\'s legal now (how it\\'s totally 100% legal for a person to manufacture their own un-serialnumbered gun.) Do people really want to go \"full fascism\" to accomplish that ?... I think many Americans would find that hard to swallow.   I just don\\'t see it as a very plausible or logical way to approach it. You\\'d think we\\'d have learned that lesson with Alcohol-prohibition or drug-prohibition. Both of those failed spectacularly. Trying to ban guns (in my opinion) would likely fail just as bad (if not worse).   &gt; \"\"Desegregating all schools is pretty much a non-starter.\" Yet here we are.\"  * \"The Data proves school segregation is getting worse\" - https://www.vox.com/2018/3/5/17080218/school-segregation-getting-worse-data  * \"School Segregation is as bad today as it was in the 1960\\'s\" = https://www.newsweek.com/2018/03/30/school-segregation-america-today-bad-1960-855256.html  * \"Why are American schools still so segregated\" = https://www.kqed.org/lowdown/30098/why-have-americas-public-schools-gotten-more-racially-segregated  * \"New Evidence on school-choice and racial segregation\" = https://www.brookings.edu/research/new-evidence-on-school-choice-and-racially-segregated-schools/  Positive progress is certainly something to strive for and work towards.. but we shouldn\\'t delude ourselves into thinking the issues are \"easy\" or \"simple\". Most hot-button issues (religion, guns, race, sexuality/gender,etc) are incredibly complex and nuanced. And should be treated as such. ',\n",

Took me 12 days to relearn how to walk. When I was released from the Hospital, I was on a full-size oxygen tank for about 30days.. as I started to venture outside and take short walks (w/ a heart monitor) to start rebuilding my heart and lung edurance. I was on Medications (blood thinners and heart medication) for about 6 months.   So all in all .. around Sept 2020 .. I was \"good to go\" and had closed out all Rehab and off all medications.   When I initially left the Hospital.. I had a few interesting side-effects:  * Had some patchy hair loss on the back of my head.. not sure why. It all grew back in just fine over time.   * I had a weird \"numb\" area on the top-right-rear corner of my skull. Again.. not really sure why. it lasted a long time (months to slowly fade away).   * for many months I had a numb spot on the back of my right-hand between my 1st and 2nd fingers. Again.. not sure why.   Primary Doctor speculated maybe some nerve-damage.. either internal (due to covid) or maybe something in the Hospital (Ventilator harness was to tight against back of head,?.. )... he didn\\'t really know.   I\\'ve been pushing hard to kick ass on my health. Alarm goes off every morning at 4:30 am I and try to do an hour of yoga (usually about 40min~ish.. still learning). I\\'m on Day 208 of consecutively closing all my Apple Activity Rings and having at least 1 workout a day. I average about 6 miles per day (walked). In JAN 2021 so far.. I\\'ve averaged 7.4 miles per day. Upped my Apple Watch goals to burn 1000 active calories a day and 60min of exercise per day (going to try to hold that through all of 2021). I\\'ll get my 365 Award in late June this year shortly after my Birthday.. so that will feel pretty awesome.   It\\'s been an incredible (and incredibly surreal) journey. Especially now as we hit 400,000 dead. I could have easily been one of those numbers. (After I\\'d been on Ventilator for 16 days.. Doctors were talking to my family about whether I had any pre-written wishes for \"removing life support\".. thankfully during those dark moments, my stats started trending back upwards and I pulled back from the brink.

Course.. in my case it\\'s also NOT just the \"38 days in the Hospital\" .. its the Rehab and at-home nurse visits and 1 month of oxygen tanks, 6 months of medications, etc.   Definitely sucks that it happened.

       "    'text': 'You know , all things considered, I’m doing pretty great.   I went into the Hospital back on 3/23. Nurses said when I came in, my O2 saturation was around 68% (Lung Xrays picture below)  I was put on the Ventilator somewhere around 3/26 or 3/28. While I was on the Ventilator, I lost 12lbs due to muscle atrophy. Also due to the heavy sedatives, 16 days of “ICU Deliriums” (nonstop nightmares). Along with the Covid19 symptoms, I also had an ecoli infection in my Bladder and a Septic infection throughout my entire blood stream. I couldnt walk or talk when I came off the Ventilator. Took me 12 days to go from wheelchair to walker to hiking pole to unassisted walking on my own again. I was on at-home oxygen (1liter per hour) for a month. Also at-home visits by Nurses and Physical Rehab for 3 months. 6 months of medications (bloodthinners and heart stabilizers).  I was discharged on April 28th and spent all of May at home in Rehab and slowly taking longer and longer outside walks (rolling along my oxygen tank and using finger-sensor to track my O2 and heart rate. Went back to work on June 2.  Today is 178 days straight closing all my Apple Activity Rings without missing a single day (never done that before in my life). I’m typically doing somewhere between 5 and 8 miles walked per day. (averaging around 13,500 Steps). My VO/2 Max has been steadily increasing, was 29 back in March. Is 35 now.    I still a little gunshy of saying “I feel 100% !” (for obvious reasons).. but all in all, i really don’t have any lingering symptoms or damage. There were things that took a REALLY long time to heal  * building back up my Heart and Lung endurance.. took months and months * I had some hand-tremors and some “numb spots” (top-rear-left area of my skull.. and also on the back of my right hand between 1st and 2nd knuckle).. those eventually faded away but took 3 to 6 months to really fully disappear. Not sure why.  * I had bald patchy spots of hair loss on the back of my head. Those too eventually grew back in and are gone now. Not sure what caused those either.   But yeah.. I’m basically back up to a full healthy and happy independent life now. I get 1 to 2 workouts in a day. Sometimes that includes 30m to 1hour of good Yoga and stretching (which makes me feel awesome). Other times it’s just going outside walking (my biggest walking day was around 18 miles in 1 day!). So to be able to do those things after I was teetering on death back in March-April.. is pretty amazing .   https://i.imgur.com/iO1Aswh.jpg',\n",

       "    'text': 'Yeah.. so many different parts of it were just insanely surreal. Pretty much from the moment I called the Ambulance,. I kind of went into this mode of \"1 thing at a time\". That\\'s really all you can realistically do.   I remember (presumably it was when I came out of ICU and the Nurses were gauging my coherence by asking me questions) and one of them said \"You\\'ve been here from March to April\".. but my brain somehow misinterpreted that as \"March 2019 to April 2020\".. and (internally) I was like.. \"Damn. an entire year?!?\".. it was funny looking back on it.   I do also distinctly remember attempting to answer the Nurses questions (\"What\\'s your name?\", \"Do you know where you are?\".. \"Do you know why you\\'re here?\".. etc).. and I clearly remember how poorly I was answering those at 1st (I kept saying I was in a different City and that I was in a \"Veterinary Hospital\" (In one of the ICU Delirium nightmares I had,. I had taken my Cat into a Vet,. and while at that Vet Clinic fell ill with Corona-symptoms and somehow convinced them to treat me).   Some of the events in the Hospital were fun. Getting all the tubes pulled out (urine-catheter, Nasal Oxygen line, Nasal feeding tube, 3-port Neck IV, etc). When the male-nurses pulled all those out,.. they were joking about the 3-port Neck IV  that \"We\\'ll need to hold pressure for about 5 to 10 minutes to make sure this clots properly\"... Ya,think?.. I appreciate that. I commented how weird it felt to have that 3-port Neck IV pulled out and they said \"Yeah, but feeling it get pulled out is better than getting it put in\". The thing they pulled out looked to be about a 2 inch coiled metal spring type thing I was like .. damn.. that was in my neck ?)   In the Covid Ward (after I got out of ICU).. it really was \"1 thing at a time\". Even if that was struggling to find the Remote to turn the TV on .. or adjusting myself in Bed in order to piss into the urinal-cup. Sometimes something would fall (like my iPhone charger cords) and i\\'d play this game with myself of \"What creative ways can I figure out how to overcome this small problem by myself (sometimes I could.. other times it was just not possible and I\\'d have to call nurse button).   The Nurses and staff there were amazing though. Professional and knowledgeable and skilled,. but also very caring and supportive and funny. I never felt at-risk or vulnerable. They took amazing care of me. There\\'s some silver-lining I guess that I got it early on.',\n",

The thing about this though,.. is that you don't really need all that much IT Staff. I do MDM (Mobile Device Management) for a living.. and the software tool (management dashboard) that I use has about 2,000 mobile-devices enrolled in it. I can sit comfortably at my desk and easily manage 100's (if not more) devices with the click of a button.   Obviously kiosks at a fast-food restaurant are different (prone to damage or etc) .. but that's generally easily insured against by having multiple kiosks (or a way to easily pull and replace a Kiosk like some kind of pluggable-briefcase). Or keep 1 or 2 kiosks protected inside a lockable sliding-wall. and if the 2 to 5 that are public accessible get broken.. you just slide/lock those down.. and reveal the reserve units. (rotating accessibility of kiosks)   That would all be pretty easy to automate.. and it really wouldn't take much staff at all. Apparently the US State with the most McDonalds is California with 1,200 or so. That could potentially be all managed by 1 IT person. (If the Kiosks connect to the Internet and are all standardized,.. you could probably manage all McDonalds across the entire country with 5 to 10 IT people. (potentially a lot more physical bodies to replace damaged/failed Kiosks.. but that can be a 30min job or less if all you're having to do is unplug/plug-in a new modular Kiosk. \",\n",

If you wound someone, their friends are going to try and get their buddy to safety and medical treatment.  This means that at least two people are removed from the fight (the wounded one, and the one carrying them), and usually three people.    The other reason is because the rounds are smaller, and weigh less, meaning that a soldier can be expected to carry more ammo for the weapon.

Also I'm assuming that the rank and file of the military would actually obey the orders to use deadly force to attack a group of people that includes all of their civilian friends and family.  Wars are lost on bad supply lines.  If a countries government declares war on it's citizenry then they are going to be severely limited in the amount of force they can use if they want to preserve infrastructure.  This means that certain weapons are going to be taken off the table right off the bat.  Not only that, but if around 10 to 15% of the population side against the government, then it will immediately severely disrupt supply chains at their source.  This means that the government is no longer able to adequately supply the military, which sets a timer on the war.  They can go until they run out of stock, and run out of money to replenish that stock.    If they do use overwhelming force to take back any infrastructure, the infrastructure is damaged, and they have to pay people to fix it.  This assumes that the people will fix it correctly/not sabotage it.  If they don't use overwhelming force, then it opens up an opportunity for the people holding the infrastructure to sabotage it before it is taken.  Again, they would have to rebuild, and would still have to worry about sabotage.  If they do use overwhelming force, then that will also further radicalize the population that they are trying to oppress (or liberate, depending on your side of the debate).    In simpler terms, declaring total war on your own population is suicide.    So, we have a time limit in which the government can retake the country before it becomes to destabilized to function.  The more force they use, the shorter that time limit becomes and the more radicalized the opposition becomes.  If it were 20 years ago, I'd probably agree with you that we wouldn't stand a chance against the government.  We've been spending money on needless wars for over two decades now though, and I don't think anyone is going to be loaning money to a government that doesn't have access to the infrastructure it would need to pay it back.  All of this means that citizens have the advantage of being able to wait out the clock.  We also have the advantage of our enemies being centrally located.  If any of this sounds familiar, it's why we keep losing wars to countries that are using Soviet equipment from the 1960's.  I could go on about this more, but this is already getting longer than I'd want it to.  Hope it gives you enough to respond to.\",\n",

If a small business rises up and takes power, it will abuse that power.  If a political party rises up and takes power, it will abuse that power.    No matter what, power will be abused.  No matter who is in power, that power will be abused.  The system we have right now - the one that got equal rights for gays, blacks and other minorities - it's pretty good.  It could be better, and it's being dissected and sold off piecemeal as we transition from a capitalist system to an oligarchic one.  Personally I'd rather break up the oligarchy and put in stronger protections to keep this from happening in the future than I would to start stealing from the productive and throwing them in jail/killing them when they refuse to produce anymore.  That's the kind of thing that caused the Holodomor.\",\n",

       "    'text': '~~I seem to remember an article here yesterday where Sater or maybe Stone (I think) apparently mentioned there were multiple tapes, from multiple hotels, in multiple cities.~~  My mistake, it was a comment in the WaPo article that broke the Trump Tower story two days ago, which mentioned that The Spectator had information on even further kompromat. My tiny sleep deprived brain somehow crossed its wiring and mixed it up with the Sater story, *mea maxima culpa*.  &gt;The dossier\\'s account of hookers in a Moscow hotel room was the subject of gossip among a select group of journalists, politicians and intelligence people for months before it was published. Now, claims are circulating of more tapes showing even more extreme behavior. Expect these allegations to emerge in due course.  &gt;https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/08/forget-charlottesville-russia-is-still-the-true-trump-scandal/  ETA I was right! Apparently, Paul Wood has alleged that \"Later, I used an intermediary to pass some questions to active duty CIA officers dealing with the case file - they would not speak to me directly. I got a message back that there was \"more than one tape\", \"audio and video\", on \"more than one date\", in \"more than one place\" - in the Ritz-Carlton in Moscow and also in St Petersburg - and that the material was \"of a sexual nature\".\" [Link to BBC article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38589427)  Perhaps the piss tape is only the most relatively innocuous kompromat Russia has on him - and Trump is panicking not because of the tape itself, but because of other tapes that may also exist.   And considering his remarks on his daughters and other underaged girls, and his general shamelessness on sexual impropriety, combined with how he kept riding Comey on the hookers when he\\'d been behind the FBI busting a trafficking ring in 2014 and seems to have a \"white knight\" thing for abused kids (much like how he later tried to warn Mueller away from his finances and family when Mueller broke Enron and is a ruthless bastard who went after their families)... either the piss tape hookers were not of legal age, or the piss tape is merely an appetizer for even worse kompromat, and Trump is  panicking because of what Putin might release or the IC might find.',\n",

The fact that all these institutions just allowed this horrible hateful speech for four years, in the name of free speech etc, despite all the harassment, harm (mental and otherwise) it caused to so many people in America actually emboldened so many to the extent that now that they crossed this invisible line, they can\\'t even really understand the ramifications of what happened. That what gets me. To be hyperfocused on the free speech or \"big brother\" aspect of these bans, not the fact that a small group of rioters were just a few feet away from irreversibly staining American history with the blood of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th in the chain of command of the United states of America, as well as overrunning the seat of power of the most powerful nation in the world, on national TV ... just tells me that things really went too far and should have been shut down much sooner.  I\\'m sure a lot of the people at the capitol that day have the narrative running in their minds that they are the heroes of America democracy, but the reality is that there is simply no justification for any of this, that can be told. A smarter group of individuals would take all this on the chin, make penance in some way while staying under the radar to regroup and reconfigure their message/approach instead of citing private business overreach as some sort of justification for what happened',\n",

Use lots of adverbs: Things are never bad they are “shockingly” bad. Actions are never outrageous, they are “stunningly” outrageous. People aren’t just demoralized, they are “dramatically” demoralized. You are never worried — you are “deeply” worried …  2. Establish credibility: Frequently mention the time you wrote the “Contract with America” or balanced the budget four consecutive years. (Note: If your background is slightly less impressive than Newt’s, simply substitute “landing that big deal with that paper company” in place of balancing the budget.  3. Reference history. Know your great leaders: Lincoln, Churchill, Thatcher, Reagan. Memorize a few quotes, too.  4. Stress how historic or important something is. When talking about a routine project at your office, always refer to it as “the most important reorganization of our company since 1965 …”  5. Go “all in” rhetorically. Constantly stress that this new deal poses an “existential threat to the very survival of your company.” (Note: Showing 100 percent confidence and strong body language are key here).  6. Describe opposition as insane. Memorize this phrase: “No rational person could believe ____.”  7. Begin sentences with the words “Look” or “Frankly.” (Also, try to throw in the word, “fundamentally” as much as possible.)  by MATT K. LEWIS\"   http://www.uh.edu/~englin/rephandout.html  The following is taken from Language: A Key Mechanism of Control, a pamphlet which was sent to Republican candidates running in the 1990 elections. The pamphlet was developed by Gopac, a conservative group headed by the then House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich. This excerpt appeared in the November 1990 issue of Harpers Magazine. From the rhetorical analyst\\'s position it constitutes a pile of examples of loaded diction (see RT&amp;C). You might want to have some fun with this by thinking about wether there would be differences between this 90 and a possible 96 list. Consider, in this regard what the implications are for the \"absoluteness\" of the terms \"negative\" and \"positive.\"  As you know, one of the key points in the Gopac [instructional tapes] is that \"language matters.\" As we mail tapes to candidates, and use them in training sessions across the country, we hear a plaintive plea: \"I wish I could speak like Newt.\" That takes years of practice. But we believe that you can have a significant impact on your campaign if we help a little. That is why we have created this list of words and phrases. This list is prepared so that you might have a directory of words to use in writing literature and letters, in preparing speeches, and in producing material for the electronic media. The words and phrases are powerful. Read them. Memorize as many as possible. And remember that, like any tool, these words will not help if they are not used.\\t Optimistic Positive Governing Words Use the list below to help define your campaign and your vision of public service. These words can help give extra power to your message. common sense\\tfreedom\\tpeace\\treform courage\\thard work\\tpioneer\\trights crusade\\thelp\\tprecious\\tstrength dream\\tliberty\\tpride\\ttruth duty\\tlight\\tprinciple(d)\\tvision empower(ment)\\tmoral\\tpristine\\tworkfare fair\\tmovement\\tpro-environment family\\tpassionate\\tprosperity  Contrasting Words Often we search hard for words to define our opponents. Sometimes we are hesitant to use contrast. These are powerful words that can create a clear and easily understood contrast. Apply these to the opponent, his record, proposals and party.  anti-child\\tdeeper\\tliberal\\tshallow anti-flag\\tdisgrace\\tlie\\tshame betray\\tdevour\\tmachine\\tsick bizarre\\tdestroy\\tobsolete\\tstatus quo cheat\\texcuses\\tpathetic\\tsteal collapse\\tfailure\\tradical\\ttaxes corruption\\tgreed\\tred tape\\tthey/them crisis\\thypocrisy\\tself-serving\\ttraitors decay\\tincompetent\\tsensationalists\\twelfare',\n",

It remained over $1 trillion per year for four years and got below Bush’s last years deficit in fiscal 2015. It continued to decrease until Obama’s last year and has increased in Trump’s first year in office.  Fiscal 2007: $161 billion (next to last year of Bush’s second term) Fiscal 2008: $459 billion (beginning impact from the Great Recession) Fiscal 2009: $1.4 trillion (Obama’s first year and in the teeth of the Recession) Fiscal 2010: $1.3 trillion Fiscal 2011: $1.3 trillion Fiscal 2012: $1.1 trillion Fiscal 2013: $680 billion Fiscal 2014: $485 billion Fiscal 2015: $438 billion Fiscal 2016: $587 billion Fiscal 2017: $666 billion (Trump’s first year of his Presidency) It is clear that the almost $1 trillion jump between fiscal 2008 and 2009 was due to the Great Recession. Tax receipts fell, expenditures rose and Obama and Congress passed the American Economy and Reinvestment Act to combat the recession.  A better way to analyze the federal debt  Using percentages is a better way of analyzing data in a lot of cases as it compensates when the data set numbers are larger or smaller from each other. Federal debt falls into this category as it increases over time. The compounding impact of growth can make using absolute numbers meaningless.  How much did the total deficit rise by each President since Reagan  Again using data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve, these are starting and ending federal debt numbers since President Reagan. I’ve computed the total percentage increase and the compounded yearly rate.  What the numbers show is that the total debt increased the most at 184% over 8 years and at the fastest rate under President Reagan at almost 14% per year. In fact, the three Republican presidents had the fastest growing debt on a yearly basis.  Reagan  Started Presidency: $965 billion Ended Presidency: $2.74 trillion Increased 184% or 13.9% per year H.W. Bush  Started Presidency: $2.74 trillion Ended Presidency: $4.23 trillion Increased 54% or 11.5% per year (only in office for four years) Clinton  Started Presidency: $4.23 trillion Ended Presidency: $5.77 trillion Increased 36% or 4.0% per year W. Bush  Started Presidency: $5.77 trillion Ended Presidency: $11.1 trillion Increased 93% or 8.5% per year Obama  Started Presidency: $11.1 trillion Ended Presidency: $19.85 trillion Increased 78% or 7.5% per year President Obama’s debt actually grew at a slower annual rate than any of the Republican presidents even though there were events that negatively impacted the deficit that started before he became President. The Great Recession is probably the biggest of them as can be seen in the yearly deficit numbers. While all politicians use data to support their positions, the sound bite that the debt doubled under Obama is very misleading.',\n",

When those changes arrive, Fox and Rush Limbaugh will helpfully provide simple arguments buttressing the new position that are easy to understand and repeat, both to people you know and, absolutely critically, to yourself. It doesn’t matter whether they stand up to scrutiny; what matters is that you have something, anything, that you can repeat when your position is challenged.  &gt;What is unchanging are the meta-themes that run through all their coverage: The world is frightening and dangerous. Things were better in the past. White people are besieged and put-upon, while ungrateful minorities have all the advantages. The non-conservative media always lie and so can never be trusted; only what we here at Fox News and other conservative outlets tell you is true.  &gt;Beside all those meta-themes, which have been in operation for a few decades now, is one of more recent vintage: Trump is always right.

HA-19-0631 &amp; HA-19-3395  Page 2 of 17  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  In a May 29, 2019 interview, Ms. Kellyanne Conway, Counselor to the President, reportedly scoffed at her responsibilities under the Hatch Act and ridiculed its enforcement by asserting, “Let me know when the jail sentence starts.”  1  Her defiant attitude is inimical to the law, and her continued  pattern of misconduct is unacceptable. The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) calls on President Donald J. Trump to remove Ms. Conway from her federal position immediately. OSC is an independent executive branch agency charged with Hatch Act enforcement. OSC opened two cases, OSC File Numbers HA-19-0631 and HA-19-3395, involving Ms. Conway in response to complaints alleging that her conduct during media interviews and on her Twitter account, “@KellyannePolls,” violated the law. After investigating these allegations, OSC has concluded that Ms. Conway has and continues to violate the Hatch Act. This report contains OSC’s investigative findings in these matters and refers the violations to the President.  Hatch Act Prohibition at Issue The Hatch Act prohibits federal civilian executive branch employees from using their official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election.  2  The attendant Hatch Act regulation provides that, for example, an employee may not use her official title or  position while participating in political activity.  3  Political activity is defined as activity directed at the success or failure of a political party, partisan political group, or candidate for partisan political office.  4  Additionally, an employee may violate this prohibition by misusing either official or personal social media accounts, and, specifically, OSC has advised that an employee may not engage in political activity on a personal social media account if OSC has determined that the account is used for official  purposes. Summary of Investigative Findings OSC’s investigation determined that Ms. Conway violated the Hatch Act during media appearances and by engaging in both official and political activity on her Twitter account, “@KellyannePolls.” Ms. Conway regularly participated in official media interviews in her capacity as a White House spokesperson to answer reporters’ questions about the Administration. Beginning in February 2019, Ms. Conway, during official media appearances, engaged in a pattern of partisan attacks on several Democratic Party candidates shortly after they announced their candidacy for President, including Senator Cory Booker, Senator Elizabeth Warren, former Congressman Robert Francis “Beto” O’Rourke, and former Vice President Joe Biden. For example, in one interview, Ms. Conway insinuated that Senator Booker was “sexist” and a “tinny” “motivational speaker.” In another, Ms. Conway said Senator Warren was “lying” about her ethnicity and “appropriating somebody else’s  1  Brett Samuels, Kellyanne Conway dismisses Hatch Act violation: ‘Let me know when the jail sentence starts,’ The Hill (May 29, 2019), https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/445914-kellyanne-conway-dismisses-hatch-act-violation-let-me-know-when-the. 2  5 U.S.C. § 7323(a)(1). 3   See 5 C.F.R. § 734.302(b)(1). 4  5 C.F.R. § 734.101.  *Edited to add rest of summary:    Report of Prohibited Political Activity OSC File Nos. HA-19-0631 &amp; HA-19-3395 Page 3 of 17 heritage.” After Mr. O’Rourke announced his candidacy, Ms. Conway attacked him for not “think[ing] the women running are good enough to be President.” In another instance, shortly after Mr. Biden declared his intention to run for President, Ms. Conway attacked his lack of “vision,” said his announcement video was “very dark and spooky,” and criticized his unwillingness to be “held to account for his record.” Ms. Conway also repeatedly singled out those she deemed to be “frontrunners” for the Democratic Party nomination — Senator Sanders and Mr. Biden. She referred to both candidates derisively as “two old white straight men career  politicians,” attacked Senator Sanders’s ideas as “terrible for America,” and brought up Mr. Biden unprompted on at least four occasions in one interview. In addition to disparaging individual Democratic candidates, Ms. Conway directed insults at the entire Democratic field. For example, she compared the Democratic Party candidates to “woodchips” and reminded the American public “anything times zero equals zero” when it came to the number of Democratic candidates and their ideas. Each of these actions constitutes a violation of the Hatch Act’s prohibition on the use of official authority to interfere with or affect an election. With respect to her Twitter account, OSC concluded that Ms. Conway uses “@KellyannePolls” to execute her official duties. OSC also found that Ms. Conway engages in significant political activity on this account. She tweeted, for example, that President Trump has “got this” and included “#2020:I’mWithHim,” mocked Senator Booker for sounding “like a Hallmark card,” and criticized Senator Warren for claiming to be Native American to benefit herself. Ms. Conway retweeted a March 31, 2019 message that referred to Mr. Biden as “Creepy Uncle Joe” and took it upon herself to outline other faults she found in Mr. Biden’s candidacy. And as recently as May 7, 2019, Ms. Conway retweeted a campaign advertisement that remarked positively on the President’s economy as compared to the “Obama-Biden economy.” Ms. Conway’s advocacy against the Democratic candidates and open endorsement of the President’s reelection effort during both official media appearances and on her Twitter account constitute prohibited political activity under the Hatch Act. Accordingly, she repeatedly continues to violate the law.  Conclusion   Numerous aggravating factors support OSC’s recommendation that the President remove Ms. Conway from her federal position. First, Ms. Conway has substantial knowledge of the Hatch Act and was previously found to have violated the law by engaging in very similar conduct. Indeed, in March 2018, she was the subject of another disciplinary action referral from OSC to the President for engaging in political activity during official media interviews. Second, OSC repeatedly requested that Ms. Conway comply with the law. OSC sent a letter to Ms. Conway about her impermissible Twitter use in December 2018, warned the Office of White House Counsel in two March 2019 meetings about her political activity during official media appearances, and sent another letter to the Office of White House Counsel in April 2019 concerning her Twitter account. Lastly, Ms. Conway failed to comply with OSC’s requests and, in fact, escalated her partisan critiques of candidates after OSC had communicated to the White House that her conduct violated the law. In sum, Ms. Conway continues to violate the Hatch Act and signals that she will not comply with the law.',\n",

Background On May 11th, 2017, TIME magazine published an article entitled \"Donald Trump After Hours,\"[1] an exclusive, behind the scenes account of President Trump\\'s life living in the White House. One paragraph in the article, which described the president\\'s particular dining habits, specifically his wait staff brining him two scoops of ice cream with pie, while his guests got one, receieved immediate attention. Reporters Michael Scherer AND Zeke J. Miller write:  The waiters know well Trump’s personal preferences. As he settles down, they bring him a Diet Coke, while the rest of us are served water, with the Vice President sitting at one end of the table. With the salad course, Trump is served what appears to be Thousand Island dressing instead of the creamy vinaigrette for his guests. When the chicken arrives, he is the only one given an extra dish of sauce. At the dessert course, he gets two scoops of vanilla ice cream with his chocolate cream pie, instead of the single scoop for everyone else. The tastes of Pence are also tended to. Instead of the pie, he gets a fruit plate.  https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/two-scoops',\n",

       "    'text': \"Criminal, Fraudulent and Prohibited Transactions [9] Paragraph (d) prohibits a lawyer from knowingly counseling or assisting a client to commit a crime or fraud. This prohibition, however, does not preclude the lawyer from giving an honest opinion about the actual consequences that appear likely to result from a client's conduct. Nor does the fact that a client uses advice in a course of action that is criminal or fraudulent of itself make a lawyer a party to the course of action. There is a critical distinction between presenting an analysis of legal aspects of questionable conduct and recommending the means by which a crime or fraud might be committed with impunity.  [10] When the client's course of action has already begun and is continuing, the lawyer's responsibility is especially delicate. The lawyer is required to avoid assisting the client, for example, by drafting or delivering documents that the lawyer knows are fraudulent or by suggesting how the wrongdoing might be concealed. A lawyer may not continue assisting a client in conduct that the lawyer originally supposed was legally proper but then discovers is criminal or fraudulent. The lawyer must, therefore, withdraw from the representation of the client in the matter. See Rule 1.16(a). In some cases, withdrawal alone might be insufficient. It may be necessary for the lawyer to give notice of the fact of withdrawal and to disaffirm any opinion, document, affirmation or the like. See Rule 4.1.  https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_2_scope_of_representation_allocation_of_authority_between_client_lawyer/comment_on_rule_1_2/\",\n",

       "    'text': \"Betrayed by who? Other voters? You can make an argument that the DNC prefers the establishment candidate, but that's always been the case. In fact, the DNC changed their rules after 2016 which was meant to include more progressive voices in the party platform. I say this as a Warren/Bernie supporter.  Here's a reply I made to someone on /r/SandersForPresident who demanded proof that the DNC made changes for a more inclusive primary and platform creation process:  Don't think all of the changes were well-publicized, but here are some sources: https://inthesetimes.com/article/21395/dnc-superdelegate-reforms-bernie-sanders-our-revolution-democratic-party  https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/25/politics/democrats-superdelegates-voting-changes/index.html  Basically in response to the (justified) complaints from Sanders delegates of the 2016 process, the new rules eliminate super delegate voting on the first ballot during the convention, and allow them to only vote on after the pledged delegates allocated from state conventions have cast a vote. One of the criticisms the Sanders camp made during and after 2016 was not to let the super delegates decide the election, and the DNC responded to that. One of the other changes the DNC made was to how state delegate equivalents are allocated, getting rid of winner-take-all states. Now, all states award state delegate equivalents are awarded on a proportional basis (rule 14 section B of the [Delegate Selection Rules](https://democrats.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2020-Delegate-Selection-Rules-12.17.18-FINAL.pdf)). There's also a sub-proportion, where 75% of the state delegate equivalents are awarded on a district level (or even lower, precinct by precinct. Rule 8 Section C). Both of these changes are more democratic and are designed to award more delegates to candidates that are not frontrunners.  You might remember it was reported that it was important for Bernie to stay in the race in order to get to the 25% threshold for the DNC Platform and Rules committees. [From a member of the DNC rules committee that's voted for Bernie:](https://inthesetimes.com/article/22417/Sanders-primary-campaign-Democratic-comvention-reform-Biden)  &gt;If Sanders stays in the race, he will have enough delegates at the convention to cross the 25% member threshold on both the Rules and Platform Committees. Under current rules, 25% of the committee members can bring a minority resolution to the floor to be voted on by the whole convention. Reaching this threshold is critical.  &gt;...  &gt;This will allow the reform movement to demand that the party continue to become more democratic. It will also allow Sanders’ supporters to insist on the passage of a progressive party platform, rather than acquiesce to the imposition of a false unity that threatens to reverse all we have gained in the past four years. There are critical areas where the platform will matter including a path to single-payer health care, a commitment to end fossil fuel investment and limiting increases in the military budget.  This became an issue during NY's cancellation of the state primary, with some fearing that he wouldn't get to the 25% threshold. However, as you drop out of the race, state delegates are reapportioned to candidates still in the race (under Rule 11, section C). In fact, as of April 30th, Bernie's delegates numbered 952 (needing around 1150 for 25%), which included delegates from candidates that had already suspended (Klobuchar, Pete, Warren, etc). Biden and Bernie's campaigns both know these rules, and because the candidates themselves want to present a unified front, [have struck a deal to allow Sanders to keep the delegates reallocated to him.](https://apnews.com/1250a619e0c8195fad1aa6aea08c63c8)  So anyway, is it fair to say the DNC prefers Biden over Bernie? Absolutely, the DNC prefers the establishment candidate, and obviously the one who garnered the most votes in state primaries. But they have much, much, less of a thumb on the scale than they did in 2016, and 2008 (when Hillary had the establishment preference over Obama).\",\n",

That may be true, but the PBGC is still massively underfunded, and talk of a taxpayer bailout have been swirling and could happen. Either way, Sears is still getting off easy by passing on their pension obligations to the federal government (and eventually, the taxpayers when a bipartisan bill will be passed to make up the difference that companies have been falling short on).

While there’s a lot to not like about them, they’re similar to the Bush (2) administration in that they’re lawful evil at worst, lawful neutral or full neutral at best. Contrast that to Trump’s administration, which is full of chaotic evil players, who both enjoy the suffering and the upheaval, and I don’t know that there’s anyone with the presence to take the codes or convince military commanders to check with them first before launching anything.

(WJZ/AP) — Former Anne Arundel County Executive John Leopold was led out of the courthouse in handcuffs after being sentenced to 30 days in jail for misconduct charges. He will also serve 30 days on house arrest.  &gt; Leopold, a Republican, would have avoided jail time under a recommendation by prosecutors. They asked for a 1-year suspended sentence, a $100,000 fine, five years of probation and 500 hours of community service.  &gt; “I think it sends a powerful message to the community and to elected officials that this type of thing won’t be tolerated,” said Emmet Davitt, state prosecutor.  What on earth did he do‽   &gt; The former county executive resigned last month after Sweeney found him guilty of forcing his staff to do campaign work and perform personal errands like emptying his catheter bag.  https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2013/03/14/former-county-executive-john-leopold-to-be-sentenced/  He was indicted for: &gt; charges of misconduct and misappropriating county funds, isn’t just accused of having his security detail ferry him to and from parking lot assignations with his mistress. Prosecutors say the Republican leader of Maryland’s fourth-largest county also had protection officers accompany him on a pre-dawn assault on an opponent’s campaign signs, compile dossiers on rivals and empty a urine bag after back surgery required him to use a catheter.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/in-anne-arundel-john-leopolds-salacious-misconduct-trial-getting-underway/2013/01/15/b4d58a14-5e71-11e2-90a0-73c8343c6d61_story.html  Best part was the victim blaming.   &gt; “I’m angry at the judge for what he did. I just think it was the wrong decision. All he did was ask somebody to empty a bag, and **all she had to do was say no**,” said Carol Vitek, former Leopold aide.  &gt; During sentencing Thursday, the prosecutor said he was troubled by a letter written on Leopold’s behalf by his girlfriend, Jane Miller.  Miller wrote about the county employee who testified Leopold ordered her to change his catheter bag and suggested she never complained about it.  The prosecution said the letter was “inappropriate and insinuated the state’s primary witness was not telling the truth.”',\n",

Figure out how to get around that cap.” “We can’t do this because there are IGs and watchdogs who might report on it? Fire those IGs and watchdogs. There. No one to report it.”   It’s already known that Trump cheats at golf and he assumes everyone cheats as well. This is just that logic carrying over into politics. Look at the mail-in ballots.

       "    'text': '&gt; Special Counsel Robert Mueller broke more than two years of silence on Wednesday to address the central mystery of his investigation: why he did not make a determination about whether President Trump broke the law.  &gt; Mueller said it was because his hands were tied by Justice Department policy that forbids indictment of a sitting president—a statement already being interpreted as an invitation for Congress to impeach Trump.  &gt; “Charging the president with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider,” he said in a surprise press conference at DOJ headquarters.  This was all Barr’s doing. Remember, Barr was brought in to replace Sessions and Rosenstein since they wouldn’t get rid of the investigation/Mueller.   &gt; But after Mueller told Barr he had not conducted such a thought experiment, Barr went ahead and did it himself.  &gt; **Barr said he concluded that even absent the OLC opinion, the Justice Department still wouldn’t have charged Trump. Mueller said he had nothing to do with Barr’s analysis.**  &gt; “That was the office’s final position and we will not comment on any other conclusions or hypotheticals about the president,” he said, clearly alluding to Barr.  Mueller was tasked by the DOJ and reported to the DOJ. If Barr had wanted to indict Trump, he could have, or at least attempted to. Instead Barr came out prior to the public release of the report and said the it totally cleared the president of any wrong doing. Something Mueller had to come out of retirement to clarify that it did not.  Edit: source   https://www.thedailybeast.com/robert-mueller-announces-resignation-from-justice-department',\n",

       "    'text': 'Well....   In 1775 you had the Continental Army which was disbanded after the revolutionary war. State militias became the sole ground armies.   In 1791 the Regular Army (est 1784) was reorganized into the Legion of the United States, then renamed the United States Army in 1796.   2A reads:  A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.  Or   A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.  If you look at it from a historical prospective, 2A was ratified in 1788, not long after the creation of the Regular Army.   In Federalist No. 46, James Madison wrote how a federal army could be kept in check by state militias, \"a standing army ... would be opposed [by] a militia.\" He argued that state militias \"would be able to repel the danger\" of a federal army, \"It may well be doubted, whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops.\"   Alexander Hamilton in 1788 wrote:  &gt; ... it will be possible to have an excellent body of well-trained militia, ready to take the field whenever the defence of the State shall require it. This will not only lessen the call for military establishments, but if circumstances should at any time oblige the Government to form an army of any magnitude, that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the People, while there is a large body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their own rights, and those of their fellow-citizens. This appears to me the only substitute that can be devised for a standing army, and the best possible security against it, if it should exist.  So long story short, one view of 2A is that is there to protect States from a Federal Army *or* protect States in the absence of a Federal Army.   I highly doubt the Framers could have predicted the advanced warfare we have now that would out gun regular citizens with long rifles and pistols.',\n",

For starters, let\\'s just look at the last 11 (Jimmy Carter won Texas in 1976 so lets start there) presidential elections and if there is a trend there:  * 1976 - 129,019 * 1980 - 629,558 * 1984 - 1,484,152 * 1988 - 684,081 * 1992 - 214,256 * 1996 - 276,484 * 2000 - 1,365,893 * 2004 - 1,694,213 * 2008 - 950,695 * 2012 - 1,261,719 * 2016 - 807,179  OK.  Based on those numbers I would say there is only a trend depending on how you choose to draw your trend-line.  If you go from 1976 until 2016 the trend actually shows a growth in the voting difference in favor of Republicans.  The average vote shortage from 1976 until 2016 was 863,386.  If you narrow the window from 2004 until 2016 that number is actually 1,178,452.  Admittedly in all this there are a million different factors that I have not put into this.  2004 was post 9/11 where folks were still pretty patriotic.  2008 was the post Bush years and folks were excited for anyone that wasn’t George W. Bush.  But there is a trend since 2004 where there was the greatest vote shortage in modern history where that number has been chipped away.  That data alone does not show a picture that Texas is going blue.  So where does this idea come from?  Demographic shift.  [There is a plethora of evidence to show that unlike the 90’s where that gap was small there is a significant change in demographics going on in Texas.](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/2018-10-11/in-texas-changing-demographics-could-have-political-implications)   “*Texas is growing more than any other state, says Texas State Demographer Lloyd Potter, and half of the growth is from people moving to Texas from elsewhere, mainly* [*California*](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/california)*,* [*New York*](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/new-york)*,* [*Illinois*](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/illinois) *and* [*Florida*](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/florida)*. And while Texas \"has sort of a wild west persona,\" it in fact is growing much more urban, Potter says. A report by the Texas Demographic Center projects that Texas\\' population is increasingly concentrated in a handful of metro areas, and that the metropolitan population will double in 40 years after 2010. Houston, Texas\\'s largest city, is one of the most ethnically and racially diverse cities in the nation and like the next three biggest cities in the state – San Antonio, Dallas and Austin – it trends Democratic.*”        This is certainly not the most scientific way to approach this because--again, not a political scientist, but let\\'s use the gap from 2016 as the mark to flip Texas.  So 807,179 votes need to either change or more people need to vote in 2020 that did not in 2016.  Is voter turnout rising?  Yes.  [2018 saw a huge jump in voter turnout in the state of Texas.](https://www.texastribune.org/2018/12/07/texas-voter-turnout-sixth-highest-increase-2018-midterms/v)  In fact, double digits.  Let\\'s look at Harris county which is the location of Houston.  [In 2016 Harris county exploded in support for Clinton.](https://www.texastribune.org/2016/11/11/harris-county-turned-blue/)  [2016 records on Politico](https://www.politico.com/2016-election/results/map/president/texas/) show Clinton winning the county 706,471 to 544,960 or a vote gap of +161,511 votes.  Remind you this was a presidential election year so higher turnout is expected.  What about 2018?  In just Harris county Beto/Blue picked up 700,200 votes to Cruz/Red 498,902.  Or a vote gap of 201,298.  So in an “off year” the vote gap in just Harris county grew by 39,787.  Taking away 40,000 from 807,179 still leaves one hell of a hill to overcome, obviously, but that is only one county as well.  And it doesn’t even consider voter turnout, population increase across the state.  [In Houston alone, prior to the hurricane it was exploding in growth.  We’re talking near 2% growth prior.](http://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/houston-population/) With all reports indicating that the city is becoming more and more Democratic it is safe to assume that the population increase is chipping away at that roughly 767,000 remaining votes.  The last factor that remains is the Trump factor.  The man has a way of getting folks off their ass both in favor of and in opposition to him.  Since the only metric we have is 2018 the only bet to make is that the turnout for 2020 is going to be huge. [Even though Texas ranked last in the nation in 2018 midterm elections they still saw a larger turnought than any time since 1970.](https://www.statesman.com/news/20181107/texas-midterm-voter-turnout-highest-since-1970) [In fact it was an 18 point jump from the 2014 midterms.](https://www.texastribune.org/2018/12/07/texas-voter-turnout-sixth-highest-increase-2018-midterms/)  I’ve only used one city as the example for Texas which is certainly not reflective of the entire state.  But statistics do show that blue support is growing in Texas in Democratic hotbeds like Houston, El Paso, Dallas and others.  Whether it is enough to flip Texas blue in 2020 is anyone’s guess.  My bet is not 2020, but 2024 or 2028 possibly.  But a Blue Texas means Republicans will have an almost impossible path to winning the White House--assuming Democrats to not lose enough states to offset those 38 electoral votes.',\n",

       "    'text': 'Since we’ve now been subjected to Trump for 3 years he is becoming increasingly more predictable with his pseudo \"unpredictability\" the media likes to portray.  What I mean by that is we know based on his tells that something is coming up.  It is still hard to decipher what is coming up, but we usually know that something is on the horizon. In his world it is almost as though there are like three tiers of feeling slighted where he will react accordingly.  The lowest is what is happening at the G-7 summit right now.  His day to day life is spent surrounded by yes men who convince him he is the absolute cock of the walk in America. He then shows up in France trying to act like he is the cock of the walk and the other nations are viewing him as the bumbling buffoon idiot that he is.   He absolutely takes notice to that.  [So because everyone else at those meetings treats him like the man-child he is he then runs into the arms of Russia by taking their side saying they should be at the G-7.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/08/26/donald-trump-russia-g-7-vladimir-putin-outsmarted-barack-obama/2121185001/)  Why?  Because then he would have even a single person who sides with him and he is most comfortable when he has powerful people in his corner.  We know that.  The second is when the media, FOX included, start to pile on to him.  The G-7 is another great example.  Pussygate is another example.  When he was called a “fucking moron” or whatever is another example.  This is when he comes out afterwards and categorically claims the opposite of what the media is saying.  He skipped the climate change meeting yesterday.  All of the media, even daytime FOX, starting questioning his motives. [ He quickly comes out stating he is an environmentalist.](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/26/trump-g7-climate-change-1475566)  Pussygate happens and he says [no one respects women more than he does](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-nobody-has-more-respect-for-women-than-i-do_n_5b576721e4b0860924774204).  Smart people call him an idiot and he brags about how high his IQ is.  It is all extremely transparent.  He has done it when folks have commented on his tiny ass hands before too and he cannot help himself but respond.   Strangely when Stormy Daniels said he has a tiny mushroom dick and yeti pubes he didn’t respond....but I digress.  The last is when he is cornered on something. This is when he does legit dangerous shit like bombing Syria. During the fever of the Michael Cohen raid he was looking more and more like a first ballot hall of fame piece of shit and he ended up bombing Syria.  Now I am sure there was some national security element to it as well, but he absolutely loved the timing of it.  Certain folks in the Pentagon may have been telling him to do it for x, y and z reasons.  [But he absolutely considered it for himself as a distraction.](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/04/led-syria-strikes-distraction-trump-troubles-180414215353247.html)  That is something he has done almost his entire life.  When he is truly in a dire situation he flails like crazy and does anything to sneak out of the situation no matter the optice.  [Remember when Trump left town and went to hang out with Kim Jeon Un in Vietnam when Cohen was due to testify before congress?](https://www.ccn.com/donald-trump-north-korea-summit-distraction-cohen-testimony/)  Last example.  How about August 26th and 27th where Trump said China called him up to negotiate.  That was a pretty blatant attempt at influencing the falling stock market.  [Especially since China publicly stated they had no damn clue when he was talking about. ](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/a35vvj/trump-said-china-called-to-restart-trade-talks-beijing-has-no-idea-what-call-hes-talking-about)  All my adult life I have heard that Trump is a master at one thing and one thing only.  Manipulating the media.  After 3 years of him being under a microscope I actually have to agree with that at this point.  When it comes to distracting the media as a whole he is some type of idiot savant at it.  He is still an absolute imbecile when it comes to anything except that though.  The downfall for him though is that Americans who are paying attention actually notice his tells immediately.  It is not hard to predict that he is going to do or say something crazy.  The thing that is hard to predict is *what* he is going to say or *what* he is going to do.',\n",

They need to make controversial videos for idiots seeking validation of their willful ignorance.  That is their income.  They know they're spewing absolute bullshit, but their position is they have a right to spread it because there is an audience for it.   When you have someone like Dave Rubin, Dan Bongino, Ben Shapiro or Steven Crowder screaming about free speech and/or censorship you can be absolutely certain they do not care one shred about speech itself being censored. They care about *their* speech being censored and only because it will impact them financially. For them when Youtube is doing would be like in the gaming world today if YouTube came out and stated that they will ban all Cyberpunk 2077 content. Effective immediately.  There is a hot topic item in the world and people like Rubin are in the process of beating the dog shit out of the topic to get every last drop of blood they can from that stone. By shutting off that valve right now it will impact them financially and that is what upsets them. When they shut that nozzle off clowns like them will try to find the next big controversy so goddamn fast your head will spin and it is because their content needs to be basically two things. Relevant and marketable to the specific demographic of person they rely on. Right now that content is anything they can paint as Trump being under attack or being treated unfairly.  You have 75 million people who voted for the loser in the election. Emotions are still raw. Normally you would have a graceful President who accepts the lame duck status and does very little on his way out the door besides spending what remains of their political capital on things like controversial commutations of sentences or pardons. But that is obviously not the case. Here we have the loser telling people he won. So in the flow of bullshit you have Trump putting bullshit on Twitter and then Rubin, Bongino, Shapiro and Crowder all sitting there like baby birds with their mouths open getting their feeding of bullshit. Trump gets away with it on Twitter because he is POTUS and they will not ban him. The other 4 clowns don’t have protected status. So they go to their platform of choice to try and parrot what they were told and they’re told the free ride of bullshit is over.  At that point their *only* card they can play is to scream about censorship. It is the hot button item that fires that specific demographic up and it keeps them on the hook until the next big news item comes along. Which I can almost guarantee you is going to be the following:  1. They’re going to bash Biden repeatedly if he comes anywhere even tangentially close to taking credit for something that Trump was anywhere even tangentially connected to. 2. They’re going to scream about Biden not doing enough for literally anything they can. Or they will scream about him overreaching for literally anything they can.  With the “Rigged Election” gravy train shut off they’re going to go back to much more rapid fire topics of the day.\",\n",

I let him go on for 2-3 minutes uninterrupted and finished by simply saying \"*You never once just said you cared at all about all the votes out there being counted and caring that like 800 votes were not counted for Biden either.  For you it is not about all the votes being counted, it is about Trump winning.*\"  He then changed his entire talking point to all the votes need to be counted regardless of who they go for.  It is funny how some of these folks get so ingrained in the bullshit about Trumps votes that they only care about Trumps votes and not Bidens.  That is how you know they do not give a shit about the votes.  They just want more votes to come in for Trump.  That is all.',\n",

The younger white woman who was voting in her first election seems genuinely like she is trying to do the right thing and hear both sides. Good on her.  I will never fault anyone for listening to Trump to make an educated decision.  Then there was the old white lady.  She said she agreed with what Trump was saying, but didn’t like the way he was saying it.  What on earth could she have possibly agreed with exactly?  All he did was attack Biden all night long.  He didn’t talk about any policy.  Not a single thing.  He shit on Biden and his son.  That was his play all night.  Any time Biden would call out Trump on his bullshit radical left comments Trump would scream “You just lost the left!”.  There was literally nothing to actually agree with.  There was nothing there.  Then there was the black gentleman in the orange shirt.  This guy actually had the balls to refer to Biden calling Trump a clown as “out of pocket” as though Biden crossed some line.  There is absolutely no chance in hell that guy was an undecided voter. None.  That guy gave a pass to Trump for 5 straight years of calling everyone in politics childish names, but he drew the line at calling the president a clown.  That man--was a fucking imbecile.  I was gobsmacked by his stupidity.  Then, it dawned on me…  That is what Biden has to deal with for undecided voters. They’re not people who actually think logically.  They are snap reaction morons who will actually vote based on Biden calling Trump a clown and not based on everything that Trump has done the last 4 years. But at the same time Trump could rage and call Biden names and as long as someone spoon fed the opinion to them they would say “Yeah it was great how Trump was forceful with what he was saying---y’know?” It was a great show of leadership.

       "    'text': '   Let me regale you with a tale of how full of shit you Trump supporters are when you try label slavery or segregation to one party.  Spoilers.  The parties moved.  The same racist ass folks such as yourself stayed in the exact same place....  Once upon a time the Democratic party was the party of slavery and Jim Crow.  The Republicans were the party of emancipation and racial integration.  Yes.  We all know that.    Republicans were the Union and Democrats the Confederacy.  Yes we know that, too.  If you need proof that there was once a massive swapping of political parties you pretty much could stop right there because anyone with a high school education knows that the south is certainly not Democratic territory nor is the north Republican territory.   Jim Crow Democrats were the dominant force of the South at that time and the socially tolerant Republicans were dominant in the North.  Things were that way until around the 1960’s when there was a shift that took place over the next 30 years thanks to the Southern Strategy.  Today it is the Republicans that are branded racist and the Democrats the ones who are fighting for civil rights.   From the late 1950’s lasting through the 1980’s the southern strategy’s goal was de-align white southern voters from the Democratic party and realign them with the Republican party.  Do you know what pitch they largely used to do that?  Civil rights.    There were a massive amount of folks in the south who did not want to see black folks have civil rights.  They are racists.  They were there back then and they are still there today.  Jim Crow Democrats started have always taken issue with slaves being free, having citizenship and the right to vote.  The parties may have moved, but the people didn’t.  They have the same racist  values today that they did in the days after reconstruction.  After reconstruction the Republican party stopped caring much about the freed slaves.  They especially ignored the Republicans in the south unless they needed them for nominations for their party during presidential elections.  This is where the big shift happens.  Due to both the Democratic and Republican party no longer representing the people they were supposed to represent Southern Democrats started to thaw on the notion of desegregation and eventually integration.  But racists still gonna be racist at the end of the day.  The Republicans see the Democrats constantly winning in the south which was then referred to as “The Solid South”  This is the way things stay until the 1950’s when Brown V Board of Education established integration as the plan for the future.  Two years later in 1956 Bruce Alger comes along. He was a Southern Republican.  He had won in 1954 as an incrementalist type, but he knew he would have a hard time winning in 1956 because a baptist minister gaining popularity in his Dallas district by the name W.A. Criswell, thought the bible believed in segregation.  So, he ran as a full blown segregationist.  Alger wins.  John Towers does the same thing and wins and stays in office until the 80’s as a segregationist.  Fast forward to 1964 when LBJ absolutely crushes Barry Goldwater’s ass.  Goldwater was a “states rights” Republican and believed in small government and was against ...civil rights. Whaaaat!?  But I thought Republicans were *for* civil rights?  Wrong! Non-Racists were for civil rights.  This is proven true when Barry Goldwater got absolutely wrecked everywhere except for Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina.  Which we today pretty much recognize as the 5 most racist damn states in America.  The shift has happened.  From this point on Republicans pander to the southern racists mindset.  They cling to the bible and racism whitewashed with the word conservatism.  They’re not racists.  They just do not support civil rights.  They do not want black folks to remain slaves.  They just do not think they should be able to work alongside white folks.  They do not think they should not get an education.  They just think they should have their own schools.  It has been that bullshit for the last 60-70 years.    The Southern Strategy was absolutely based around political survival of the Republican party and the Republicans failure to listen to the folks they are supposed to represent.  The parties absolutely did change.  The only thing you can blame modern day democrats for is not listening to their constituents at the time which allowed it to happen.  You can remove parties from it entirely.  Racists and bigots have *always* lived in the South of this country.  So whether it is Democratic or Republican or anything new in the future.  If it is rooted in the south it is almost guaranteed to be the party most closely aligned with racism.',\n",

The extreme left and the extreme right completely illegitimize the other side, the liberal and conservative side, which we need in certain places. The two extremes illegitimize those two sides. Or they exaggerate that side’s stance into an irrational state that makes no sense and that’s not fair when either side does that,” McConaughey added. \"  This is really the only part of his interview that is worth reading.  He\\'s not wrong if we lived in that reality.  But he also seems to believe in this fantasy world where both sides come to the middle and have a battle of ideas where the best idea wins and that is not the reality we live it.  One party has weaponized instruments of politics like the filibuster to stop all progress.  One party has vowed to table literally anything that comes out of the House.  One party has shut down our government and screwed the middle class every chance they could in an effort to get taxes cut for the wealthy.  I agree with him 100% that the extremes on both sides are a part of the problem.

       "    'text': \"Based on what we know now having seen that disastrous first debate I think it is pretty simple to calculate what Biden needs to do from here on out.    Number one he needs to do no harm.  No gaffs.   A major gaff and the right will run ads with that from now until election day in every swing state in America.    Secondly and most importantly he needs to paint Trump as someone who cannot control himself.  He did that already in the first debate to an extent.  If I am Joe Biden's team I would  be brainstorming as many possible ways as I can to dangle red meat in front of Trump that I think will get him to interrupt and go on a tangent. Then--every single time he does it Biden should take that opportunity to lecture him on needing to listen to the American people and stop making the debates a waste of their time.  I would have an entire list of ways to combat his impulsive moments:  * “Listen to the American people and stop turning this into a debacle” * “Do you have uncontrollable outbursts like this in the situation room?” * “The American people do not work for you.  You ought to be listening to them and control yourself so we can have a meaningful debate here.” * “Are you OK? Do you need a moment Mr. President?” * “Are we going to have to pause to placate your tantrums all night?” * “I’d like to speak to the American people if that is OK with you Mr. President.”  I would be doing that all night long. Just keep implying that he is impulsive and cannot control his impulses.  Here is the huge thing.  IF they format the next debate to where the moderator can cut off microphones.  Biden’s mission needs to be to make that happen to Trump as many times as he can.  That WILL be the talking point if it happens more than once--guaranteed.  Keep baiting him and baiting him because we know he cannot control his urge and just be quiet while someone else speaks.   Then all Biden has to do is keep talking to the American people and try to get as much policy information out as he can.   Finally, Biden needs to stay above the pool of shit that Trump operates in.  He *cannot* take the bait to be dragged down to Trump’s level.  He got his few insults in calling him a clown and all that.  But now it is time to move past that.  If he does those things I think the undecided American people are going to think that Joe Biden is the man to vote for.\",\n",

Our country did not shatter from this.  This might actually be the first shooting where the country collectively shrugs its shoulders and thinks \"*Just another day in the U, S of A.*\"  Here is how I know I am not wrong too.  There were literally students who were in the building who went on camera while there were still dead bodies inside the building and calmly, I want to stress calmly, looked at the camera and just flat out said that this is going to keep happening until the adults in the room start doing something.  The kids just lived through a school shooting and they still had the wherewithal to just calmly point out that this is jsut todays shooting and there will be another one tomorrow.  That is absolutely fucked up and why I think you are wrong that this shatters our country in any way.  Yesterday was Valentines day and a Wednesday to the majority of people in this country.

I know plenty of farmers here in the Midwest who are selling off their milk cattle and getting into strictly selling beef cattle so they can maintain their farm while going and getting a day job as well.  Hell my own in-laws are apparently mulling over selling off their $300,000 worth of milking robots.  They would lose a shitload of money from what I understand too because they need to run them for 10 years to pay them off.  I also know a number of soy-bean, rye and corn farmers who aren\\'t even going to make enough money off their crops this year to pay off their operating loans they took out in the spring.  It is crazy.  This is all over Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa and Nebraska.  If Iowa and Wisconsin flip blue and Michigan normalizes back to blue Trump is in a world of hurt for 2020.  They are extremely upset with Trumps policies, but they are also against \"socialism\" so they like folks like Biden who they perceive as *moderate*.

Al Franken used bad judgement for certain.  But what he did was in no way something that should cost someone their entire career in politics.  But at the end of the day #MeToo doesn't look at anything at a scale.  They treat Al Franken the same way they treat Donald Trump.  They just think he is a  rapist effectively.

I know some of you will argue that this doesn't accomplish anything, but [you may be surprised](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/22/us/politics/heres-why-you-should-call-not-email-your-legislators.html). Most of us have nothing but time on our hands these days, so there's no excuse for not taking this small action. Get involved!\",\n",

There were quite a few students standing around watching, trying to catch a glimpse of the famed real estate magnate. Don Jr. opened the door, wearing a Yankee jersey.

He simply said \"put on a suit and meet me outside,\" and closed the door.*  *Donald Jr. was a drunk in college. Every memory I have of him is of him stumbling around campus falling over or passing out in public, with his arm in a sling from injuring himself while drinking. He absolutely despised his father, and hated the attention that his last name afforded him.

Since we've seen how delusional wealthy people can be about what the public thinks of them, I'm inclined to think that he's just out of touch with reality here.  Also, he's paying his staffers too much money for anyone to make an effort to convince him otherwise.  I can imagine people on his staff cashing in while they can until he drops out and they jump ship to the next nominee.  But I appreciate the conspiracies that have been proposed that this is the only way he can run unlimited anti-Trump ads, etc.  In the end it's probably just delusions of grandeur driving him, but the idea of Bloomberg, an _actual_ billionaire, blowing a pile of money just to stick the knife in Trump is poetic and beautiful.  Hey, ping me and let me know if you hear any interesting angles on this, it's damn intriguing.\",\n",

Watkins, the founding member and senior counsel with the firm is, quite candidly, beyond description. As lead counsel in countless cases garnering both national and international attention, Albert S. Watkins has demonstrated unrelenting trial skills which have rendered witnesses subjected to his cross examination incapable of speaking; caused multinational billion dollar companies and their teams of legal counsel to capitulate; and otherwise garner favorable media attention for even the most disgraced clients. Opposing counsel in the infamous The North Face Apparel Co. v. The South Butt case described the most dangerous place in the world as being the space “between Al Watkins and a microphone.”  &gt; **Self-centered, egotistical, and a self-proclaimed expert in all matters**, Watkins is unabashed about bringing to the public eye the irreconcilable nature of a position taken by an adversary in a case. A founding member of the Board of Directors of the U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform with former U.S. Attorneys General Edwin Meese and Dick Thornburgh, Watkins worked to facilitate tort reform legislation in the United States. Refusing to wither in the face of daunting opposition, Watkins pushed back on behalf of Major League Baseball star Jack Clark when Clark was sued by baseball legend Albert Pujols after asserting the latter used steroids or performance enhancing drugs, **publicly challenging the Dominican born to take a lie detector test**. In State of Missouri v. James Strughold, Watkins **successfully defended a white elementary school principal accused of felonious sexual misconduct involving ten African American third-grade students**. The principal was fully acquitted of all charges following two full jury trials.  &gt; When the Obama mask wearing rodeo clown appeared at a state fair in Missouri and garnered international attention for making racist comments, a school district superintendent announcing the rodeo was erroneously named as the maker of the offending comments. Watkins not only reversed a global media error in attribution, including front page clarification in the Habana, Cuba state owned paper, but he brought to the fore the counterintuitive prioritization by the media of inconsequential minutia while the world erupts around them.  &gt; In Hammon v. Harris, **Watkins garnered the first verdict of its kind against a young female who falsely accused a policeman of engaging in sexual relations and snorting cocaine with a female patron of a restaurant at which the policeman was working a security shift**. When the defendant would not appear for her deposition, Watkins procured an order mandating the woman be brought into custody and held in jail pending her deposition. During the ensuing video deposition, Watkins swiftly got the woman to confess and admit the allegations were false. The video deposition swiftly became an internet sensation. **A six-figure judgment was entered in favor of the policeman. The woman committed suicide thereafter.**  &gt; Watkins is known for his attention to detail and his intimate familiarity with all aspects of the financial industries. He is engaged to demonstrate his advocacy skills in courtrooms throughout the United States and is **called upon to serve as a color commentator on legal issues and cases by national television networks**.  &gt; **A radio personality in his own right**, Watkins hosts his own nationally syndicated radio vignette, an eight minute show aptly called Watkins Word, in which he waxes poetically about the news and events of the day, employing a decidedly conservative Midwest American mindset, a mindset Watkins refers to as having been born of “rugged individualism.”  &gt; Watkins sold hot dogs from a cart during his undergraduate studies and proudly proclaims this undertaking “the best job” he ever had. The father of five, Watkins has no time to waste and enjoys the challenges associated with serving and addressing the needs of clients in a punctilious and committed fashion. **Watkins does not hold hands well and admits to being incapable of singing “Kumbya”**. A cancer survivor since 2003, Watkins is proud that “nothing scares [him] anymore.”  Sounds like a class act.\",\n",

The vast majority of people I knew who are my age were horrified at the ludicrous overreaction of Congress and the Bush Administration in the years after that.  As soon as there was a bill proposed called the \"PATRIOT Act\" and people started talking about \"homeland\", I knew the delicate balance we were on was destroyed.

Legalizing marijuana will help with the symptoms, but helping one addict kick is hard, tens of millions is nigh impossible.  This is like trying to get society to quit smoking in the 1950's, it's a multi-generational problem _even after we right to establish the science around it_.

Make sure that they are registered to vote and that they do actually go vote. Offer them a ride to the polls with you if you need to.

[(14)](https://www.motherjones.com/coronavirus-updates/2020/03/trump-says-hell-ignore-key-oversight-provision-in-stimulus-bill-1/) Either way, the Take Care Clause makes it illegal.

I'd frankly question if they'd keep records of literal genocide, personally. I suspect the inspector general will have to track down the individuals mentioned in the course of their investigation. At the very least what they already did find is highly unethical and illegal, and add to that all the other nasty crap ICE has been doing to detainees and none of it paints a very pretty picture.

[Volunteer](https://joebiden.com/call/) - you can make calls right from your home, staying safe from COVID-19. Don't just assume Democrats will win because the polls. Clinton was up in the polls and won by 3 million votes but still lost the electoral college. And there's a lot of fuckery going on this year, especially with the USPS. Until these people are out of office nothing will change, and no real accountability will occur. Vote and get out the vote like your lives depend on it.\",\n",

       "    'text': \"I'm not a fan of this article personally with its 60% cut in foreign bases &amp; dropping war funding entirely.  [Lindsay P. Cohn](https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/SSQ/documents/Volume-09_Issue-3/Cohn.pdf) and the [MCRMC](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/AS/AS00/20150204/102859/HHRG-114-AS00-20150204-SD001.pdf) highlight more sensible measures to reduce military spending.  I don't disagree that we should vastly reduce military spending. We spend more than the next 10 countries **combined**. We should probably reduce it to somewhere around 2% GDP (~$388B) rather than ~3.7% GDP (~$717B) - which is what is expected of NATO members. The military will require restructuring and doing away with its bloated budget and egregious wasting of taxpayer dollars. But it can be done.   We're stuck in a benefits trap at the moment, but if some of the more popular progressive agendas were implemented, would be rendered largely unnecessary.  Many future benefits should be converted to up-front cash rather than in-kind benefits. Performance-based bonuses should not be considered as they are not popular among service members. Child, youth, and school services should be dropped as they're not valued as much as the costs to provide them (and other programs would likely make them redundant under progressive policies that provide such). Education will (largely) be unnecessary to fund as that will be covered with other programs (tuition free college/university). Health care (one of the biggest chunks of military spending) would also not be necessary with universal healthcare (medicare for all).  The nuclear arsenal I'd posit could be done away with entirely, in favor of [Rods from God](https://www.businessinsider.com/air-force-rods-from-god-kinetic-weapon-hit-with-nuclear-weapon-force-2017-9) (Project Thor). We basically put telephone pole sized tungsten rods up in satellites and just drop them down to do damage equivalent to nuclear weapons but without the fallout. The only reason we didn't really do it when the idea was first introduced was because it was prohibitively expensive back then. Now, not so much. Reason? If we're going to have weapons of mass destruction we may as well be able to actually **use** them. We couldn't, for instance, nuke DPRK without radioactive fallout going all over South East Asia, including South Korea, Japan, and China - possibly Russia. Rods from god though? Not a problem.  Overall the budget's just a mess of inefficiency, corruption, and fraud that just keeps getting shoveled more money because nobody really wants to address the core problems. And it's not that they don't have enough money. With more than the next 10 countries combined, it should be fairly obvious it's just rife with horrible financial management. A lot of waste probably just goes to bureaucratically shuffling paperwork. That, and we're horribly wed to a few manufacturers that basically have their own little monopolies with no competition.  Just take a look at military spending.  * US: $717 billion * China: $168 billion * Saudi Arabia: $82.9 billion * Russia: $63 billion * India: $57.9 billion  The total of the next 4? $372 billion. Even if we dropped from 3.7% of our GDP to 2% we'd still be spending $388 billion, more than the next four combined.  In 2015 the US accounted for 37% of all military expenditures worldwide.([source](https://www.nationalpriorities.org/campaigns/us-military-spending-vs-world/)) As of 2019 it's still 36%.

They will reject democracy\" - David Frum  They\\'ve been rejecting Democracy for a few decades now. Gerrymandering, voter suppression, voter roll purges, outright election rigging, and more. And the electoral college plays right to their favor since it can make a vote in a super rural area worth like 5 times as much as a highly urban one. It\\'s why Clinton and Gore lost despite winning the popular vote.  Outright denying Obama a Supreme Court nomination then stealing it, denying Obama judge nominations of any kind then ramming through their own once they were in power. Outright rejecting to even bring up thousands of bills the House passes for a vote. Refusing to even hold a proper impeachment hearing. Now trying to destroy the post office. It\\'s a direct subversion of democracy.  It should be obvious that this is a full on coup and has been in plain sight for decades.  As Democrats we\\'re too naive and expect people to make actions in good faith. But we aren\\'t dealing with people that act in good faith. We\\'re dealing with corrupt sociopathic ratfucking bastards out for themselves that have rejected democracy and the very core of America itself.  Trump himself is a lot worse.

But I think his death was a systemic police brutality problem which goes well beyond race, despite racial profiling in which people of color are disproportionately targeted.  You're seeing it all across the country right now. Black people only make up ~11% of the country's population. Following that statistic it makes sense the pictures &amp; videos I've seen of the protests the majority of protestors appear to not be black. Yet the brutality is indiscriminate once someone is targeted.  We need to fundamentally change the way police officers are trained, requirements to even be hired in the first place (like psychological testing to keep the worst out), and how they're held accountable for their actions (or rather *not* in current conditions; i.e. remove qualified immunity).  We should probably also not allow body cameras to be turned off or obscured, and the police shouldn't be the ones in charge of safeguarding that footage. An independent public body should be in charge of safeguarding it, though the police should be able to fairly easily request the footage to view. The footage should also be uploaded constantly. Streamed live if possible, with higher quality uploaded later through a better connection.  People shouldn't have to even consider that if they say the wrong thing or if they just get the wrong police officer that things could go very badly. Like bodily injury and arrested on false charges. It happens all the time when there's a bad cop on a power trip. And that, is fucked up.\",\n",

These are the decisions that said that money is speech, corporations have First Amendment rights, and they can spend money in politics - virtually unlimited sums of money. We need to completely get rid of money in politics - permanently, and forever.   Our two major political parties aren\\'t going to want to do this because they\\'ll think they need that money. But they don\\'t really need that money. What they really need are campaign funds. So forget these donors. Give the party what they really need: Campaign funds. Draft it right into the same amendment, law, bill, or whatever it is, so that while political campaigns can\\'t be funded by any private party or corporation, there\\'s going to be a public campaign fund set up. The percentage of the country\\'s electorate will determine how much money each party gets, with certain set minimums so things are fair. This way the Republicans and the Democrats are going to get most of it but all these little parties like Greens and Independents, they\\'ll still get some funding. Probably enough to run their campaigns, and if they become more popular they can get more funding. The parties themselves can determine after the minimum funding how much funding any particular campaign should get, that way they can be strategic with how they spend their party\\'s campaign funds.   To pay for it, you can do any number of things but if you want some cosmic irony you can add a very small tax to people that make over $250,000 a year, a slightly larger but still very small tax to people that make over $1,000,000 a year, and a small tax on very successful businesses. So now all these donors, they\\'re funding your campaigns whether they want to or not. Politicians don\\'t have to worry about it anymore and can focus on the country rather than their campaign funds for their next election.  Re-implement Glass-Steagall laws which were repealed in 1999 which were set in place after the Great Depression and protected us for 7 decades whose repeal led to banks becoming too big to fail.  Up until 1985 there was something called the Fairness Doctrine that kept news honest and balanced. After that repeal is when the news started becoming entertainment with the goal of driving profits. We also need to ensure the equal-time rule that specifies radio and television stations must provide an equivalent opportunity to any opposing political candidate to request it applies to other coverage of the candidates which are currently just considered \"news events\" and aren\\'t required to follow the rule. With these kinds of rules in place someone like Donald Trump never could have gotten so many untold billions in free advertisement from the media without giving equal coverage to his opponent.  And add DC + Puerto Rico as states. Though frankly, I\\'d like to abolish the electoral college and change the senate\\'s representation to population based. As it is the senate gives the minority far too much power over the majority of the population.  Add term limits to the Supreme Court. There is no position in America that should be for life. We rebelled against England to get away from people that held power for life. Additionally, the President should not nominate nor should the Congress confirm Supreme Court nominees. Instead, they should run for office and be elected by the people.  Take pardoning power away from President.  Remove ability for the President to fire members of the DOJ, law enforcement, and intelligence agencies.  Make it illegal to arrest or detain people during peaceful protests, unless they turn violent. We\\'re becoming an authoritarian police state and it\\'s quite ridiculous how police prevent people from peacefully protesting. People shouldn\\'t even need a permit to protest. That\\'s utterly ridiculous.  Pass a law to prevent the Speaker of the House, Senate Majority Leader, and various other congressional leaders from stopping legislation from even coming to a vote if a certain number of senators or representatives support the measures. A single individual shouldn\\'t have that much power, it\\'s fucking insane.',\n",

If the House transmitted the documents immediately, that could delay the new Democratic-controlled Senate from voting to confirm Mr Biden’s Cabinet nominations when he takes office later this month.  &gt; “Let's give President-elect Biden the 100 days he needs to get his agenda off and running, and maybe we'll send the articles sometime after that,” Mr Clyburn said in an interview with CNN on Sunday.

They have taken the blind faith and rejection of critical analysis associated with religion and conferred that to their party by linking their party and a religion. Once they were able to convince people of that, that they were the party for their religion, then people started conferring that blind faith that must be utilized as the core basis of their religion and transferred it to the political party. So now when they hear something contrary to what their party has told them and shown evidence to the contrary they don\\'t even want to see it and reject it, at times even coming up with elaborate excuses - if they even feel the need to provide any whatsoever, which they probably don\\'t.  You\\'ve seen how absurd it\\'s gotten. Religion sponsored on currency (it wasn\\'t originally), in our pledge (it wasn\\'t originally), Christian prayers in congress, religion in our courts, religion at the forefront of politics - most controversial positions all tied to religion. Something like an open atheist running for office and the chances of their getting elected seems abysmal. In a nation with freedom of religion it shouldn\\'t matter. But it does, it\\'s been tied to a core principle of the society. And at this point we\\'re rapidly becoming a theocracy - and we\\'re right on the cusp of it, too. Especially with zealous SCOTUS judges like Amy Coney Barett. Heck, if you watch religious programming a lot of them talk about politics in-depth, most of them far right leaning - especially pro-Trump, many even talking about him like some kind of messiah. Church &amp; state should have never been joined like this, for this very reason.  And the tenants of the religion itself actually has nothing whatsoever to do with its utilization - you can see examples of that with Al Franken\\'s Supply Side Jesus which illustrates the Republican ideology that claim they are Christians prescribe to beliefs that are the polar opposite of Christianity. They were just a tool to be used to confer that blind faith and gain support. They saw the inherent weakness and exploited it. It was really about enrichment of the super wealthy who, along with their thinktanks, probably thought this whole scheme up. And when you watch what the Republican agenda seems to be in Congress - consistently passing more tax cuts and loopholes for the ultra rich while fucking over the poor and removing safety nets with the hyper religious stuff a lot of times just as political stunts for support, it starts to make a lot of sense.  It started in earnest with the Buckley vs Valeo, Citizen\\'s United, and McCutcheon decisions and you can look and since then the rich have consistently gotten richer while everyone else has gotten poorer - among other measures favoring the rich over everyone else. I\\'ve posted about that before.  As for the media, until 1985 there was something called the Fairness Doctrine that kept news honest and balanced. After that repeal is when the news started becoming entertainment with the goal of driving profits. There\\'s also something called the equal-time rule that specifies radio and television stations must provide an equivalent opportunity to any opposing political candidate to request it applies to other coverage of the candidates which are currently just considered \"news events\" and aren\\'t required to follow the rule.  Oh and religion was added to currency in 1954, and to money in 1955 - you can thank President Dwight Eisenhower for that fuckery. In 1914, the Senate began adding the Chaplain\\'s prayer to the Congressional Record. In 1970 New Jersey Senator Harrison A. Williams \"reminded his colleagues of James Madison\\'s strong objection when the post was created in 1793\", and \"noted the modern fulfillment of another of Madison\\'s warnings, that there would inevitably be discrimination in the appointment of such a chaplain against the (then) smaller denominations such as Catholics and Jews.\"',\n",

Which political party has blocked every attempt at an independent ballot audit?  This could have all been avoided if the Democrats had allowed an audit and examination of voting machines. Instead, Democrats were literally saying independent audits would undermine the election. That doesn\\'t sound like they were very confident in the results of the election.     &gt;The affidavits are complete junk.   My favorite part about many of the affidavits is they corroborate a claim made about a year earlier.. by Elizabeth Warren. See before Nov 3 it was actually the prevailing narrative that the 2016 elections were compromised and that we needed to avoid electronic voting machines.  [From Elizabeth Warren\\'s report](https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/H.I.G.%20McCarthy,%20&amp;%20Staple%20Street%20letters.pdf):  &gt;In 2018 alone \"voters in South Carolina \\\\[were\\\\] reporting machines that switched their votes after they\\'d inputted them, scanners \\\\[were\\\\] rejecting paper ballots in Missouri,   &gt;   &gt;And, just this year, after the Democratic candidate\\'s electronic tally showed he received an improbable 164 votes out of 55,000 cast in a Pennsylvania state judicial election in 2019   &gt;   &gt;These problems threaten the integrity of our elections and demonstrate the importance of election systems that are strong, durable, and not vulnerable to attack.  Isn\\'t it crazy how these findings were almost verbatim what was in the affidavits? What a wild coincidence. Also all of the affidavits were under oath, and nobody has actually challenged their validity legally speaking.     &gt; The video is real, but you are being lied to about what\\'s happening.   Yes, by people in the media and government. The government said that they had ballot watchers in the room the whole time. The video shows nobody in that room watching. The media initially said the poll workers went home that night, then changed the story to they never went home.  Maybe you can look at plain as day security footage of one thing while being told another, but I can\\'t do that. There are four lights.',\n",

       "    'text': '&gt;NATO will be the strongest it has been in a while with the US contributing a larger share than ever before.  Do explain how letting our NATO partners fall behind on their defense spending and relying on the US military for any sort of response to Russian aggression is strengthening NATO? That was Obama\\'s policy for 8 years, and Biden seems to want to return to it.  Germany is the second biggest member of NATO and the EU economic powerhouse. They can\\'t even meet their 2%GDP commitment to military spending even after committing to it every NATO summit. With Trump they finally laid out a timeline for that goal. **2030**. If that doesn\\'t sound bad enough..  During war readiness exercise late 2019, the Bundeswehr revealed itself to be in an absolute tragic state. It\\'s at its lowest point of recruitment in its history. Less than half of it\\'s mighty Leopard tank fleet was operational (about 100 tanks). They had 8 attack helicopters operational, and a dozen medium utility.  The Luftwaffe is even worse. About 30 warplanes were operational out of hundreds.  That\\'s supposed to be our second biggest military power in the entire alliance, and yet pretty much every other European power has better warfighting capability.  Under Obama, and again under Biden, the alliance will be weakened as the various NATO partners go back to minding their own business with no overall strategy. Germany has deliberately been undermining NATO cohesion for years with it\\'s reliance on Russia for it\\'s energy needs, essentially funding Russia through their currency collapse. With Trump he at least got the ball rolling on some unified goals in NATO planning, fortifying Poland and keeping the alliance focused on Russian aggression. He sold new weapon systems to the various NATO members (except Turkey) around the world.     &gt;America first is at complete odds with giving money to foreign countries to fight Russian and chinese expansion.   Except that\\'s not at all what happened. The US massively expanded and fortified Poland and increased Navy operations in the Black Sea. Trump authorized new missile defense and anti tank weapon systems to Ukraine. Japan and Korea got subsidized fighters to bolster their air power against Chinese aggression. The Trump admin restructured the whole DoD to focus on fighting a two state war with a new military doctrine \"multi domain operations\" and establishing a dedicated space warfare branch *specifically* to counter Russian and Chinese space warfare agencies.  Your take on this is hilariously bad. I would take somebody more seriously if they had told me 2+2=5.     &gt;The old neocon guard, who essentially established the SEA wall against Chinese incursion into the south China sea are at home in the Biden administration.   [Which is why week one the Chinese flew a massive sortie into Taiwanese airspace](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-55788359).  \"As a young member of a Foreign Relations Committee, I wrote and I said and I believed then what I believe now:\\xa0 That a rising China is a positive, positive development, not only for China but for America and the world writ large.\" - Joe Biden, May 9 2011',\n",

You're going to have to explain how every one of them is incorrect. You saying that you have determined my post to be false is worth as much as a magic 8 ball.  Here we go! [Poll numbers](https://twitter.com/Rasmussen_Poll/status/1329741803025801217/photo/1). Polling is all over the place, and it's never all that accurate, but we do have multiple polls out now showing Democrats in the 30% range when it comes to thinking there was fraud. This fluctuates based on polling location, I've seen as low as 2% from 538, but I've seen plenty of polls in the 20-30% range, which is a big number.     &gt;The only thing that you claimed that had any truth to it was the idea of people getting other people's ballots.  All you established was some countries have automatic registration. That's not even something I referenced in my original post. Beyond that, you have ignored all other aspects of my point. You didn't mention anything about IDs or signatures, post markings, or timelines.  [Here's what happened during our elections](https://whyy.org/articles/pa-supreme-court-rules-mail-ballots-cannot-be-rejected-based-on-signature-comparison/). The Democrats and their PA supreme court stooges decided that ballots cannot be rejected on the basis of invalid or missing signatures. Then the secretary of state [ordered that ballots received without proper postal dating should be treated as if they were properly dated](https://i.imgur.com/nzMagn7.jpg).  Find me a functional democracy that throws out any form of ballot verification like we have. [Election officials in PA don't even know how many ballots they even mailed out](https://www.post-gazette.com/news/vote2020/2020/05/15/Allegheny-elections-manager-doesn-t-know-how-many-duplicate-ballots-were-mailed-out/stories/202005150137). None of these ballots have identifying markings, no barcodes or serial numbers like you see in other nations.     &gt;none of the affidavit writers would testify under oath  What the fuck is this? **All of those affidavits are sworn under oath**. They never got a chance to testify in a trial because no court actually heard evidence. Many of those who signed affidavits testified in the election hearings put together by local and state politicians.     &gt;That did happen, it was in relatively small amounts but it happened and it was checked and corrected.   How do you know this? How does anybody know this? There were no full scale audits in any jurisdiction other than Antrim Co. MI. If you're going to claim there was no evidence of voter fraud, then you cannot also make the claim that these things were corrected. The way to identify voter fraud and correct duplicates ballots is the exact same process.     &gt;here's the heritage foundations data on fraud for the last 20 years or so state by state.  First of all the heritage foundation does not speak for the whole right. That foundation is very specific in its goals, and rarely applies to the rest of the right wing. It virtually had no policy impact for the Trump admin.  Second, this data doesn't even include the last election.  [Do stories like this not exist to you](https://www.kxan.com/news/texas/ag-paxton-woman-accused-of-voter-fraud-in-san-antonio-arrested-charged/)? This is the woman caught by project veritas. She collected thousands of ballots and changed their votes. The GA election was literally determined by a few thousand votes, and one woman was able to do that. The only reason she was caught is she was exposed by some journalists that actually take voter fraud seriously.     &gt; i took the time to research every line you have in this  Was your source [joebiden.com](https://joebiden.com)?

Years of 95+% negative media coverage, and the viral popularity of being the most TDS is going to have an effect on the perception of his communication.

The Republican and Democrat parties as they exist are incredibly diverse parties that actually contain sub parties known as caucuses.  Problem is the establishment of the Republican party is out of touch with the political realities of the current political landscape, and I doubt they\\'ll recover anytime soon. They refuse to see why Trump won, and why people supported Trump.  I\\'m a Republican through and through, but their absolute weakness to stand up for themselves has me to the point I don\\'t give a shit what happens to them. My biggest reason to support them was gun rights, but that only matters if you plan to comply with gun restrictions.  I am perfectly happy to watch the Democrats plunge us nose first into woketopia. I want to see their entire progressive platform realized, because I have spent the last 6-8ish years pushing against it only to be called crazy because \"the Democrats are too moderate\" for that.  People need to experience an unchecked woke agenda to wake them up about who the Democrats really are.

The GOP as a party that includes Jeff Van Drew and Ted Cruz. You can't really get more opposite.  Meanwhile in the Democrat camp, when the party leader gives orders, allof them fall in line.

Trump got 70% to Biden’s 29% in 2020, the fact that Manchin got elected in the age of Trump is a political miracle.  As much as Manchin annoys me and I would much prefer a much more progressive/liberal senator...he’s much better than the most moderate of republicans like Romney, much less the likes of Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley (who would fit in just fine in WV politics).',\n",

However, this is a state law issue, and even within states, would be county regulated (see Nevada.)  The upshot to legalization would be that there would now be a legally-backed, market driven value on sex acts.  This means that women who tend towards promiscuity to attract mates will have to offer more than just sex to attract mates after legalization.    It may be a catalyst to a new sexual relationship conservatism.    It may also increase in fatherless children, abortion rates, and STDs as instead of attracting through non sexual methods, some women will double down and offer what legal prostitutes can't: condom free sex.  Ultimately, I have no strong feelings on this matter and it is at the bottom of the list of things I vote on.\",\n",

I don't dislike black people for being black. I do dislike career criminals for committing violent crimes, like George Floyd holding a pregnant woman at gunpoint while his friends ransacked her house.  I don't think George Floyd deserved to die that day, but he was a bad person, because he was a violent criminal, *not* because he was black.  &gt;choked to death  The autopsy indicated his trachea and hyoid were intact. That's not consistent with choking. I believe the official cause of death is cardiopulmonary arrest, as in his heart stopped. Probably wouldn't have happened if he didn't have extremely restricted coronary artery flow.  &gt;George Floyd was murdered  Murder requires intent to kill. I do not believe Derek Chauvin intended to kill a man that day. I do believe a charge of manslaughter is appropriate.  If Chauvin hadn't restrained Floyd the way he did and for a full minute after he was unresponsive, Floyd probably wouldn't have died. If Floyd hadn't been a chronic drug user, Floyd probably wouldn't have died. But I guess that makes me racist.\",\n",

Ignoring the severe ethical implications, from a purely pragmatic perspective, this move would lose Trump voters.  2. Democrats already don't care about the constitution. Blatantly abusing it in a partisan manner would only validate left-wing claims that the constitution is unfair. It would energize Democrat voters and give them a moral imperative to violate the constitution, in addition to their existing inclination to do so.  3. In any conflict, both sides can, should, and usually will use the worst weapon either side is willing to use. If Republicans were to make laws effectively privileging themselves over Democrats, we could expect Democrats to do the same.

Pragmatically, if you abolish freedom of the press, you're begging for a totalitarian shithole. Just because your guy is in power now doesn't mean you'll agree with the next guy. Any future authoritarian could strangle the public discourse such that political dissent by the press is illegal, even if they're only speaking truth.  Ethically, you're arguing for an abuse of power, to oppress your enemies because you think they're wrong. Maybe they are factually wrong, but the solution to that is not to seize their outlets and turn them into pro-state propaganda.  Freedom of the press is a good thing because it lets the good guys talk, too. Without it, the only things you'll be allowed to hear are what the state says are okay.

This passage should illustrate that point.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; “What happens if they need to show that they\\'ve been vaccinated to get  into a grocery store or a pharmacy, and that\\'s not something that their  phone is capable of doing?” asks Maimuna Majumder, a faculty member in  the Computational Health Informatics Program at Boston Children\\'s  Hospital and Harvard Medical School. “I don\\'t think that anybody who\\'s  trying to create a smartphone app for a vaccine passport is thinking  through that lens. That creates a situation where you\\'re going to have  to back-engineer solutions, which from a software development point of  view is not something that you want to be doing.”   &amp;#x200B;  Think about, really think about what we see Prof. Majumder saying in this piece. He\\'s talking about the use of hunger as a weapon in order to force the taking of an experimental \"vaccine,\" in clear violation of the Nuremberg Code, based on a repeatedly debunked model of spread and a threat that is only perceived because of a popular refusal to understand Statistics. He doesn\\'t just say that this will happen, but does so casually, as if this horrible violation of individual rights wasn\\'t even a thing that needed to be discussed.  At this point, we\\'re getting deep into Joseph Stalin territory.  I\\'ve been doing a continuing piece called \"How to get past the censorship online, as you resist the lockdowns\" (two parts, so far: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/EndTheLockdowns/comments/m8mtqw/how_to_get_past_the_censorship_online_as_you/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/EndTheLockdowns/comments/mivzgk/how_to_get_past_the_censorship_online_as_you/)), about how to get past that which has made this lunacy possible, but one subject I haven\\'t gotten to (yet) is what the endgame looks like. There\\'s this assumption that I find that a lot of people are having trouble letting go of, that life is just going to go back to being as it was before. That everybody will calm down, come back to their senses and normality will return. I even [recently got to deal with somebody](https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/mjew49/colorado_finalizes_decision_to_ease_mask_mandate/gtd8yi7/) who thought we had to do to end all of this was to vote out the people currently in office. This, months after some very credible reports of what really sounded a lot like election tampering, which just made it even more absurd.  Embrace this reality, because there is nothing that you or I can do to change it: the old normal is not coming back. We can\\'t vote it back, because as we have seen, the government is free to discard our votes, because any effort to get the ball rolling when an election looks like it was been fixed will be stopped quickly, by censorship. We can\\'t vote it back, because with the single exception of the governor of South Dakota, both parties have gotten into bed with Fauci and the doomers. We can\\'t vote it back, because too many of our fellow citizens have been brainwashed at this point. Most importantly, we can\\'t vote it back because we don\\'t have time.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  How long can you survive without food? Any asthmatic, at this point, can tell you exactly what going a few weeks without food is like, thanks to Amazon\\'s slowness in delivering our bandanas and keffiyehs. One gets very weak before the first few days are out. After two weeks, one can hardly move. Practically nobody will survive past a month and really, nobody is in any shape to fight after week two.  If we want to avoid being forced into this experimental drug trial, we need to see the blue state cities for what they are. These places are death traps, and we need to get out. Now.  \"Yes, but I\\'ve got a lot of friends, here, now, and my career is finally taking off and ...\", somebody will start. I understand their point of view, but they need to see this clearly. One can get a new career. One can find new friends. But if one gets killed by an experimental drug, one can\\'t get a new life. One is just dead. Death is for keeps.  Any damage done to your DNA is something that you\\'re stuck living with, for whatever remains of your life. Read up about \"adverse events\" in drug testing. There are more than a few people who did not get to go back to living their lives as they did before. They ended up permanently damaged, the harm done to them being managed, not cured. As I keep saying, being a guinea pig is inherently dangerous, not a thing to be chosen lightly.  Let us be real. Our governments have revealed themselves to us. They are manned by the worst of the worst, narcissists, sociopaths, sadists and crooks. Our institutions have been corrupted beyond redemption. There is no way back to the old normal from here. When a society reaches this point, all that it can do is end. One can delay the end for a while, but only at the expense of stretching out the misery. Our misery, and that of the children in our lives.  This is the reality: this is the start of a new era. You might not like it, and I surely know that I don\\'t, but it is what it is. If you cling to the conventional expectations and conventional choices of an era that is over, trying to carry on as if nothing had changed, you\\'re going to learn that everything has changed, the hard way. Life is going to smash you flat.  To Hell with the new job, the friendships and those flowers your mom planted in the backyard before she died. You\\'ve got to find a place of safety and you\\'ve got to go, now. That\\'s the end game, and that\\'s what we should be aiming for. Not to return places like Chicago or New York back to sanity. Just to get a respite from the lockdowns, the mask mandates and the forced participation in medical research that will last long enough for us to rent the trailers, load them up and get the H\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* out of here, without being harassed too much by the karens and the cops they call on us. After we\\'ve left the cities of Crazyland behind, and brought our families with, those cities won\\'t be our problems, any more.  Run. We need to run.  I\\'m suggesting Texas and Florida as options, because not only are they relatively free states but - and this is important - they\\'re free states with seacoasts. Escaping from them will be a lot easier than escaping from South Dakota. It\\'s a big world out there. Let\\'s keep our options open.',\n",

       "    'text': 'You seem to be conflating two very different subjects: that of being for or against the current Covid vaccines, and that of being for or against vaccines in general.  The concern about the Covid vaccines is not that they\\'re vaccines, but that they were rushed into use without adequate testing. Also, the mortality risk from Covid is low for most people (those who aren\\'t elderly, obese or immuno-deficient), so weighing off the risk from taking what is still really an experimental treatment against the risk from a relatively weak, overhyped virus, I find that getting vaccinated against Covid makes no sense.  Cost-benefit calculations like these have nothing to do with being anti-vaccine or anti-medicine. A familiar example of this: colorectal cancer can strike at any age, but usually, older ones are the ones who are screened for it. This isn\\'t because doctors don\\'t care when young people get cancer. But (among other considerations), there is a mortality risk that comes with the screening, which can have complications. If the probability of dying from those complications exceeds the probability of the test finding a cancer to treat, then testing is clearly not in the patient\\'s best interests, and it won\\'t be recommended, because it shouldn\\'t be. Factor in the fact that the test isn\\'t free, and that just gets a little bit clearer.  This much is just common sense: the treatment should never be worse than the disease. Hippocrates said it, himself: \"first, do no harm.\" But a lot of people have let rhetoric and their out of control emotions overrule common sense.',\n",

       "    'text': \"&gt;I just don’t understand why pedalling COVID as higher risk than it was known to be on an individual level was considered the right approach.  The assumption built into that question is that those making the decisions were trying to do the right thing. The whole fiasco becomes easier to understand from a cynical point of view. This would suggest that the cynics were right: that the lockdowns were motivated by opportunism, not misguided principle.  The big box stores loved the lockdowns, because their smaller competitors were kept locked down for so long, that many of them went out of business. The social networks loved them, because they kept people at home, where they spent more time online. Politicians loved them, because they were getting more power than they ever dreamed possible. The trolls on social media who started the panic loved the lockdowns, because of the misery they caused.  While none of these motives are noble, they're all in character for the people to whom I'm attributing them. Trolls really are sadistic. They're known for this. Corporate execs really are greedy sociopaths, as a group, and kind of short sighted. Politicians do tend to be power hungry. While some have dreamed up elaborate theories about global resets, and the British royal family being alien lizard people (or whatever r / conspiracy is saying these days), I'd say that there's a simpler explanation.  When a society has a lot of bad people running around, and there are no real social consequences for being a bad person in most cases, bad stuff is going to happen, because by sheer chance, something will come along that will give too many people an excuse to act on their worst motives at once. It will just be a matter of time.\",\n",

Sorry about that, I had to go deal with real life for a little bit. Some of it was pleasant (a friend held a movie night upstairs). A lot of it wasn\\'t, but just had to be handled.  &amp;#x200B;  Somebody who is also subscribed to r/NoNewNormal might wonder if I\\'m going to end up rehashing [this old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/lz0a4z/greatreject_subreddit_is_gone/gq214cr/) from 26 days ago, in which I mention two hosts that stood out through their refusal to censor: [Deadjournal](http://www.deadjournal.com) (a blogging host running on Livejournal\\'s old, open sourced code) and [Gab](https://gab.com/) (a vaguely Twitter-like site with groups). The answer to that is \"no.\" While those two sites could be enough to keep a wrongly deleted subreddit\\'s community alive, by themselves, they aren\\'t enough.  Easy to forget (because it\\'s so hard to believe): the Constitution has, to a large extent, been shredded at this point. Since [I last posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/EndTheLockdowns/comments/m8mtqw/how_to_get_past_the_censorship_online_as_you/), President Biden has openly conspired with the business community in order to create \"vaccine passports,\" in an attempt to deny the American people the freedom to refuse an inherently dangerous experimental \"vaccine\" by ensuring that those who don\\'t take it won\\'t be able to do business. We do business every time we earn money by working or spend it on food, so what he is trying to do is leave the American people with a \"choice\" between becoming guinea pigs in a clinical trial for a vaccine to protect against a virus that presents a far less serious threat than the vaccine does, or slowly dying of starvation out on the street. Had the government of another country adopted a policy like that prior to 2020, without hesitation, with nearly a single voice, the American people would have called that country a \"rogue state,\" as this would be a blatant violation of the Nuremberg code adopted after World War Two, and an uncivilized thing to do. But now, we live in a world of rogue states.  One has to wonder if we\\'re really free to hold demonstrations, any more, unless we\\'re going out to riot for Antifa or BLM. Sure, Joseph Biden swore to uphold the Constitution of the United States, and there can be no serious doubt that the first amendment to that Constitution protects our right to hold demonstrations. Any claim that the founding fathers couldn\\'t have foreseen the possibility of a pandemic at the time is laughable - consider the smallpox and other epidemics of their era. But the governors of all 50 states swore oaths to uphold both their state and the federal constitution, both of which clearly spell out a separation of powers between the legislative and executive branches of government. In 49 out of the 50 cases, what happened to those oaths? In the case of the city of San Diego, we need not speculate.  [https://fox5sandiego.com/news/local-news/woman-facing-arrest-possible-charges-for-organizing-downtown-protest/](https://fox5sandiego.com/news/local-news/woman-facing-arrest-possible-charges-for-organizing-downtown-protest/)  The police, there, spoke of prosecuting a woman calling herself \"Naomi Israel\" for her role in planning an anti-lockdown demonstration during April of last year. This, then, is just simply a fact - the Constitution, at this point, is worth little more than the fragile, centuries old paper on which it was written. We can\\'t count on it being there for us in any meaningful sense, should we get arrested. We need to plan accordingly, working around the assumption that the police will, themselves, break the law.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  In practical terms, this means that even though we are not going to violate anything that legitimately is a law (\\\\*), we have to act as if we were planning a crime, because the police will respond to it as such. The fact that the current trampling of rights is based on an irrational panic makes our situation worse, not better. When Japanese-Americans were wrongly imprisoned during WWII, as unjust and inexcusable as that was, they could look forward to a specific event that would end the hysteria that took away their freedom - the end of World War Two. When the War was over, it was over, everybody was going to know about it, and that hysteria was going to dissipate, because a defeated enemy is not a feared one. As crazy as the fear of a Japanese fifth column in the US was, there was a real threat (that of the Axis powers) that could really be defeated (and was), that the crazy reaction came in response to, so there was a costly, but straightforward way out of the madness.  But in this case, our loss of freedom comes, not as an irrational reaction to a real threat, but as one to a threat that has largely been hallucinated. We have healthy, fit people in their 30s and even their 20s who, no matter how many times they are pointed in the direction of the data, will go on believing that they are in deadly peril from Covid. The oppression has been based in a delusion, and those need little in the way of support from external reality to continue existing. Full blown lunacy like that has a life of its own, one that can continue indefinitely.  Embrace this as the reality, then: when we plan things that we are going to do in the real world, in person, offline, we have to plan them in secret, unless we want to get railroaded, too, just like that woman in San Diego.  This is why just using Gab and Deadjournal wouldn\\'t be good enough. If you\\'re going to do something that is going to be treated as if it were a crime, even though it really isn\\'t, as any attorney will tell you, the last thing you want is a written record of your scheming - or, as they\\'d put it, \"conspiracy.\" That\\'s evidence that a prosecutor can use to put you behind bars, much to the delight of the urban and online mobs, to be sure. You posts on Gab probably won\\'t be visible to somebody who isn\\'t logged into Gab (one major difference between Gab and Twitter), but that won\\'t really help, because Gab accounts are free and anybody, including the people in law enforcement, can get them.  What, then, can we do to reduce our risks? Not eliminate them, as that\\'s impossible. What can we do to reduce the likelihood of being arrested and imprisoned on a trumped up charge, based on an unconstitutional edict?  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Just by asking the question, we\\'ve half-answered it. We need to do our planning in a place where there is no permanent record, which is why you don\\'t want to blog about this. In the pre-Covid panic past, I probably would have said something like \"get off the Internet, meet in a coffeehouse (or even better, in a park), write down nothing and just talk to each other.\" Which is why the lockdowns were (and are) such a deadly threat to freedom - in most cases, they completely eliminated the possibility of holding face to face meetings in private. We were left with the very scenario that the free assembly clause was designed to prevent, *almost*.  Even in the worst lockdowns, there is still one way to meet, using the tools our oppressors have left to us. Let me introduce you to [Second Life](https://secondlife.com/). Second Life is a virtual world, in which one can find more than a few moments of cringe. One also finds a few million users, a lot of virtual space to get lost in and - and here we get to the truly interesting part - the option of using voice. In one of these simulations, the sound of another user\\'s voice is reduced as one \"moves away\" from him in virtual space, and other users can be seen on a virtual map as they \"approach.\"  A lot of the \"sims\" (virtual locations in SL) are empty, most of the time. Within the sims, there is something called (I am not making this up) a \"slurl\" allowing one to specify any given precise location. One could, on one\\'s blog, announce a location for holding a virtual meeting, in advance, providing a slurl and a time. As people log in, they could use the \"slurl\" to have their avatars \"teleport\" to the right location. A little goofy sounding in a science-fictionish kind of way, but it gets you a private place to talk. A virtual place, but a place.  Have some backup locations, with slurls for those ready to be used at a moment\\'s notice, and make sure that you and your evil co-conspirators swapped email addresses in advance of the meeting. Let\\'s say that somebody \"approaches\" and you\\'re got a bad feeling about him. Or somebody at the meeting seems a little off, like somebody who might rat you out. One option would be to quickly send an email to everybody in the group who you want to still see at the meeting with a slurl for the virtual place you\\'re going to pop off to. Then you all teleport, leaving the problem person with no way to trace you.  Why all of this complexity, instead of just heading over to Zoom? Because Zoom will listen in on you. Second Life, which has a lot of data to deal with already, and a lot less money, probably won\\'t bother. Storing the voices of millions of people, all chattering at once, would take a lot of diskspace, diskspace that costs money, and LindenLabs is not rolling in it. Also, their site has such a reputation for goofiness that hardly anybody is going to expect it to be used for anything that is not silly.  In this case, expectations should be left unbroken, I would argue.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Let\\'s say we set up a protest. Now what? What do we do? Walk around and chant repetitively, as protesters have since the 1960s, maybe taking to the streets? No, people tune out the chants, and as for blocking traffic, one can get arrested for that and rightly so. It\\'s a public safety hazard, because by snarling traffic, one can keep emergency vehicles from getting to where they need to be in time. Also, think of the usually liberal protests we\\'ve seen, at which the protesters wave to the people in traffic, and the people in traffic wave back. One finger at a time. Usually the same finger.  Yeah, we wouldn\\'t be making friends, so let\\'s be nice and not do that. Teach-ins, then? Have statisticians and physicians show up, and explain where the doomers went wrong in their analysis? Ever teach a math class before? I have. Even there, getting the underclassmen to listen is a mighty struggle, and they chose to be there, so getting the general public to listen to a talk about the branch of Mathematics that even other mathematicians tend to find dry? Good luck with that.  What, then? Think about the real reason why the extreme, totalitarian ends of the political spectrum got as much youth support as it has seen during the last few decades, support that has lingered later into life. Not the idealistic explanation we\\'d like to believe is true, of the kids heading out their door one morning, thinking \"today is a good day to change the world\" and seeking out their fellow young revolutionaries. A world that worked that way might have been a beautiful place, maybe, but none of us have ever really lived in it, and I think we all know that, even if we pretend otherwise.  No, the real reason is because the very Far Left at some point was perceived as being the fun side of the political spectrum. Then political correctness happened, love for one\\'s fellow man was linked in the minds of many with preachy SJW unpleasantness and, G-d help us all, the Alt-Right (including more than a few literal neo-Nazis) started being thought of being the fun crowd, and we got the edgelords. The edgelords terrorized various minorities for a while, giving Antifa and BLM a chance to get thought of as nice people out fighting authority and ... yes ... having fun.  For all of the ugliness, and it has been considerable, there\\'s a lesson to be learned out of all of this. One should never start serious. Start out silly and goofy, and don\\'t be afraid to return to silliness and goofiness, frequently. That should be our initial plan - don\\'t go out to deliver any lectures or express our rage, however well founded it might be. Don\\'t critique the oppressors, mock them and have fun doing so. Fun is what the kids are honest enough with themselves to admit that they want, when they\\'ve not being shamed into pretending otherwise. It\\'s also what their more \"mature\" elders want, too, in reasonable measure.  Sprinkle in a little seriousness along the way, so you can still say it\\'s a demonstration and make a claim on those first amendment freedoms that the home audience won\\'t feel completely comfortable about rejecting, but keep it light enough that the college and grad students who hear about it will wish they were there. This is a reaction we should want, because the more kids who come out, the more civil disobedience we\\'ll get, nudging the police in the direction of giving up. Also, as thicker crowds gather, and people go on not dropping like flies, the collective delusion will start to fade.  Call it \"reality therapy.\"  &amp;#x200B;  (more later)  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  (\\\\*) Governors can not establish laws by fiat, nor can presidents.

       "    'text': 'By now, probably everybody here has figured out a few things.  &amp;#x200B;  1. Two more weeks was a lie from day one. When the politicians imposing these grossly unconstitutional denials of our civil liberties (1) and said that they would only be doing so for two weeks to \"flatten the curve,\" they were just stalling. 2. These \"stages\" we\\'re hearing about are more of the same. \"We\\'re moving from stage three to stage four, aren\\'t you excited, Illinois?\" No, we shouldn\\'t be, because it\\'s a ripe, steaming load of horse s--t, with some bulls--t on the side, and we\\'re being asked to dig in.  &amp;#x200B;  We\\'ve been through this. We get to stage four and oh! oh! oops! found some more cases, we\\'ll have to go back to stages one. It\\'s like a game of shoots and ladders being played in Hell, one that we\\'re not allowed to win. This will keep going on, if we let it.  One other thing that probably almost everybody is realizing - if *all* that we\\'re going to do is lay out our case here and appeal to the good judgment of our fellow man, then we\\'re going to get nowhere. Reality check: it has been a year. The discussions we\\'re having now are really the same discussions we had a year ago, and where is the surprise? The doomers are cranks. We\\'ve all dealt with cranks on the Internet, before, the only difference is that these cranks have managed to get their crankery backed up with force. A crank, on seeing all of his talking points debunked, won\\'t give up and admit that he\\'s wrong. He\\'ll just return to his first talking point and start the \"discussion\" all over again. His usual strategy is to keep the discussion going in circles until you give up and walk off, and he can pretend that you had no answer to give to those brilliant arguments that you just got done debunking, repeatedly. If that doesn\\'t work, he\\'ll complain that you\\'re saying the same things over and over, and when you point out that this is because you\\'ve been replying to somebody who has been saying the same things over and over, he\\'ll fall back on some mindless cliché, maybe the one about blaming other people for one\\'s problems. Meanwhile, one\\'s audience has kept getting bored and walking off, so in the end, the crank \"wins\" because there are no witnesses to his rhetorical defeat, allowing him to pretend that it never happened.  It\\'s the scuzzy approach of a low functioning narcissist who so craves the attention and validation he hasn\\'t been earning honestly, that he will gladly spread nonsense and do damage to the lives of those around him, just to get noticed and have the ego rush of getting his own way. The doomers have been getting their own way for almost a year, now, in part because so many members of their opposition (that\\'s us) have been willing to play their game by their rules. How could they not win, when we\\'ve been so cooperative? Cooperative at a time when the game has been rigged in favor of the trolls and cranks more thoroughly than it has been in the past. As one anti-lockdown subreddit after another gets deleted by conveniently anonymous admins who will hallucinate TOS violations into existence in order to defend these acts of censorship, those trolls and cranks are only going to be encouraged to push on more aggressively, knowing that the record of those lost arguments will go on being dropped down the memory hole.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  What do we do, then? Let\\'s remember a moment of success that we had, here in Chicago, and why it happened. In Chicago, unlike New York City or Los Angeles, one can walk down the street unmasked and not get bothered by the police. While relatives in NYC were stuck inside last summer, like many of the residents of Chicago, I was free to sit outside in the Sun, reading my books, sipping my water, not being bothered by anybody. These are freedoms that, pre-March of 2020, almost everybody took for granted, but these days, they\\'re remarkable. More so, because we\\'re enjoying them in the middle of a major city. I live within easy walking distance of the Loop, Chicago\\'s downtown high rise business district, in the most densely populated neighborhood in the city.  Why is that? Is it because our mayor and governor are so much nicer and more reasonable than de Blasio and Cuomo? No. Pritzker makes Bill Gates seem humble by comparison. The man (and I do use that word loosely) did go on the air and announce that he was locking down the state because the voters were disobeying him during St. Patrick\\'s Day in 2020, and that made him mad. Lori Lightfoot is the psychotic pol who ordered the Chicago PD to stand down as rioters tried to keep people trapped inside the buildings they were burning down. Our political leadership is as bad as almost anybody\\'s is, in America.  Are we enjoying these small freedoms because our cops are good people who won\\'t enforce the tyrannical orders? No, definitely not. Long before the riots, the CPD was so out of control, that Amnesty International was talking about their behavior and the KGB was sending its compliments.  What, then, went right? What went right is that on March 21, 2020, as 5 pm approached and the lockdown was about to begin, a large number of us defied it. We didn\\'t have a debate, we didn\\'t appeal to the politicians to be reasonable, we didn\\'t even try to persuade our fellow citizens to stand up for their basic human rights. All we did was find some park benches and sit out butts down, in defiance of Mayor Lightfoot\\'s order, one that demanded that those passing through the parks keep moving.  On talking to each other later, a lot of us found that we had had the same idea. If a cop approached one of us and told him to move along, he\\'d get up (denying the cop an excuse to carry out an arrest), walk until out of sight, find another bench, and sit down again. Lincoln Park (the park I was in, when the lockdown started) stretches for seven miles along the lakefront. We could have kept doing this all day without even needing to leave the park or sit on the same bench, twice. The plan (one a lot of us seem to have come up with spontaneously) was for us to do our part to drive the police insane. As 5 pm approached and I sat down, and looked around, I could see every other bench in view getting used in the same way. People were sitting down, everywhere. Mass civil disobedience.  That\\'s why we have the freedom to sit outside in Chicago. Not because we persuaded the politicians or the police to be nice, reasonable people and give us our rights, but because some of us went out and took our freedom back. We didn\\'t have a discussion about the issue, we didn\\'t try to win the support of the sheep before acting, we just did what needed to be done, that day. The cop who I expected to see drop by and order me to move along never showed up, because he didn\\'t exist. The only thing that eventually got me to move out of a comfortable spot was boredom. I got up, moved around and wandered through an unusually packed park, with groups of people sitting on every bench.  Then we did something very stupid, and when I say \"we,\" I\\'m including myself. Having gained that little bit of ground, we did not pursue the advantage we had just gained. Instead, we wasted our time getting sucked into endless online debates about the lockdowns that weren\\'t ever going to go anywhere, because the people we were arguing with weren\\'t trying to be reasonable. In the process, we got distracted from the one thing that really worked - turning off the effing computer, and disobeying those orders that the mayor and the governor never had the authority to issue in the first place. We allowed the momentum of a powerful moment to be lost, because we wouldn\\'t let go of unproductive past habits.  Shame on us, and on me in particular. We should have known better. I\\'ve being running social media groups for years. I certainly had no excuse for the cluelessness I displayed as I let myself get played in that manner. But we can always learn from our mistakes and leave them behind, as we move on to better choices. So, let us start doing so.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  I\\'m going to start talking about how we might do so, later today. Somebody is due to drop by my place at 1:30, and I haven\\'t showered or had breakfast yet, so I\\'ll have to leave this a lot more unfinished than I\\'d like, for now, but I\\'ll continue this in another post.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  (1) Not to mention violations of separation of powers.',\n",

       "    'text': '&gt;Don\\'t think I\\'ve ever heard anyone say that a vaccine is going to \"mess with my DNA\"  You need to catch up, then. The current \"vaccine\" is a vaccine in name only. It\\'s a form of gene therapy, intended to induce an immune response that would result in resistance to Covid. They aren\\'t injecting the patients with a weakened form of Covid, which is what a vaccine would be, traditionally. This is an experimental medical technology that has been rushed past the normal safety protocols, with the companies producing it shielded from legal liability for any harm done to the patients.  If you take the jab, you\\'re a guinea pig in an inherently dangerous clinical trial. There is no way, after a few months of testing, to know what the long term side effects would be, and the history of gene therapy is not a reassuring one. I have already heard physicians express a willingness to use deadly force on anybody who tried to forcibly inject them with this stuff.  The problem is that a lot of people will have a knee jerk reaction to the word \"vaccine,\" having some vague idea that \"vaccines are good\" and drop their guard. No, even a true vaccine can be dangerous - that\\'s why there is a long, time consuming process for testing new vaccines before a legitimate roll out will be allowed. There are bad vaccines that harm the volunteers and end up being abandoned. But over the last year, we\\'ve had a public panic, the panicked people have formed into mobs, and the government has catered to the mobs.  It has been a self-sustaining mess. Many of the claims being used to support current policy could be shot down in about five seconds with a trip to any half-way decent research library, but those have been shut down. While liquor stores and weed dispensaries have been declared \"essential,\" departmental libraries have been declared to be frills, shut down by force, allegedly for the sake of social distancing. Ever been in the stacks in a departmental library? In my entire life, I\\'ve never seen a crowd in one of those, even once. But, shut down they\\'ve been, in a way that has proved convenient for people trying to spread a narrative that is contradicted by the facts.  Find something inconvenient for that narrative during a search, and more often than not, Google or Bing (who search engine results were low grade and easily manipulated before the panic) will soon hide it. So now, we run into high school dropouts who post copypasta in an attempt to pass themselves off as scientists, as they support the latest bit of madness, go looking for something that we know exists because we\\'ve actually been to graduate or professional school and know our subjects, only to discover that it has been dropped into a memory hole by the people in Silicon Valley. People working for companies that have profited mightily from the Panic and the shutdowns.  This has gotten to be more than little bit Orwellian.',\n",

       "    'text': 'Two hours after I posted the tweet above, Brandon Gowdridge of Canada shared [some wisdom of his own](https://twitter.com/VE7ZBG/status/1379243837755887617), writing  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Remind them that without viruses manipulating our DNA over human history, we wouldn\\'t be where we are today.  &amp;#x200B;  One might say that same about mutations. What Brandon fails to understand is that evolution has not been acting over a historical time frame, over a period of centuries or even a few millennia.  As others have noted, if one were to take a Neanderthal, shave him down, give him a bath, a haircut and an overpriced suit, and send him into the Board of Trade building, nobody would blink. That \"early human\" whose ancestors diverged from our own a half of a million years ago, would be little more than an example of very slight variant on our own species. Evolutionary time scales are measured in millions of years, not in centuries.  If one agrees to the scrambling of one\\'s own DNA thinking \"what could possibly go wrong,\" let\\'s take a look at what mutations routinely do to the babies who inherit them. This is not going to be pleasant viewing.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abcsZZ9Duxw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abcsZZ9Duxw)  As for what even a carefully planned genetic change can do to a human being who is well past conception, I suppose you could ask Jesse Gelsinger. If you have some way of visiting people in the Afterlife and coming back, that is. So far, efforts in that direction have proved less than successful.  [https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Jesse+Gelsinger%22+%22gene+therapy%22+death](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Jesse+Gelsinger%22+%22gene+therapy%22+death)  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  One has to eventually ask \"how can people be like this.\" How could anybody seriously believe that a random re-design of one\\'s own body would tend to lead to anything other than disaster? Who would agree to let a well meaning idiot tinker with his car? Really, just about nobody, and a human body is far more complex than a car. Yet here, we have Mr. Gowdrige asserting that random changes to its design would be just fine, because they\\'ve been happening throughout history.  The reason that mutations have been able to drive evolution isn\\'t that we live in the warm, caring, nurturing universe of a pantheist\\'s imagination. Mother Nature is a cold hearted, psychopathic b\\\\*tch who culls the weak without mercy. Those babies you see in those formaldehyde jars weren\\'t healed by the loving touch of Mother Earth, they died in agony if they ever attained awareness, at all. This is how evolution works - through random changes in our DNA, with the vast majority of the mutants dying after they fail to breed. Nature, very infrequently, introduces random changes and then leaves the randomly altered children to sink or swim. Beneficial mutations are very, very, very rare (for what should by now be obvious reasons), but over a period of millions of years, even rare things will happen by sheer chance. Much the same way that, while one\\'s chances of buying a winning lottery ticket are very low, with millions of people buying them, we expect to see a winner, sooner or later. Only, in this lottery, the losers don\\'t go home and buy another lottery ticket. Mainly, they die.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  This is why Brandon is wrong. Dangerously wrong, and governmental policy is being set by officials happy to cater to mobs of people who are guided by that same kind of over-confident ignorance. The sort of uneducated people we\\'ve seen in here, trying to pass themselves off as scientists while posting copypasta. I\\'ve lost track of how many people I\\'ve caught playing that game (ran into yet another one, just last night).  The Dunning-Kruger Effect has become an existential threat.',\n",

       "    'text': 'Worth looking at, but the author still manages to slip some nonsense in with the common sense. Quoting [the article](https://archive.is/jVc19):  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;If you’ve ever wondered how civilised societies succumb to fascism or communism, now you know. Emergency. Panic. Control. Some readers will find it distasteful to compare lockdown Britain to Lenin or Mussolini, but even if the justification for our pandemic response operated on a far higher moral plain, the result was still totalitarian in structure. Think about it. An entire population was banned from going out. The economy was controlled by the Government. Protesters were arrested.\\xa0   &gt;   &gt;There were nights when people stood outside their front doors to applaud the heroes of coronavirus labour, an act of cathartic mass participation that was never mandated but was policed by ordinary men and women – the frighteningly keen enforcers of lockdown, [happy to shop neighbours to the police ](https://archive.is/o/jVc19/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/04/06/lockdown-turning-us-nation-hypocrites-snitches/)for breaking the rules. Journalists were permitted free speech, which was nice, but we were warned of its consequences, that our words could kill others or lead to our ostracism from polite society. Never in my lifetime has speaking one’s mind felt so dangerous.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  A \"freedom\" that one can\\'t exercise without fear isn\\'t much of a freedom. Have we not heard this line before? \"You\\'re free to speak, as long as you accept the consequences that come with that speech.\" How different is that, really, from the neighborhood bully saying \"you\\'re free to walk down that street, as long as you accept the fact that I will beat you up for doing so\"? How could one not have that \"freedom,\" if freedom is being defined so broadly as to cover that? Such a \"freedom\" means precisely nothing, at all.  As for the \"higher moral plain,\" sorry, no. Yes, I\\'ve dealt with the English before, and I am familiar with the traditional idea that one has a duty to respect every viewpoint for the sake of peace, but if there was ever a time to discard that tradition, this would be it. When people have spent a year displaying a post-factual contempt for the truth and silenced others for the sake of promoting an effort to take control of the lives of others, there is absolutely nothing moral about that. As the author acknowledges himself in this anecdote  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Last week I was queuing round the corner for a takeaway, like a scene from Soviet Russia, and overheard two men – younger than me – discussing the risks of leaving the house. They were scared to go out, they said; they didn’t even like how many people were outside this shop, standing so close together. Perhaps the boys were good people who spent the day delivering food to the elderly, but from what I heard their primary reaction to Covid wasn’t altruism (I don’t want to give it to someone else) but fear (I don’t want anyone to give it to me\\u2009).\\xa0   &gt;   &gt;Never mind that the statistical likelihood of them dropping dead is incredibly low: popular reaction to Covid has been a lesson in the power of animal instinct and how swiftly it is transmitted to the top of the state, directing policy the way that nerve endings send messages to the brain.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  a lot of the grassroots support for this widespread denial of personal freedom can be attributed to the extreme cowardice of the teens and twentysomethings who were so afraid of their hair fraction of a percent mortality risk, that they wanted everybody chained in place, unable to go anywhere or do anything. Cowardice so selfish, that these kids cheerfully supported policies that condemned cancer patients to certain death, in order to protect themselves from risks that were dwarfed by those they accept any time they got into a car.  None of this is admirable, and none of this can see even faint praise without morally corrosive effects following.',\n",

These people are driving me crazy.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;The chief medical officer said that up to 25,000 people die in a bad flu year without anyone noticing and that accepting some Covid deaths would be the price of keeping schools and business open and allowing people to live a \"whole life\".   &amp;#x200B;  **No, no, no, no, no**. And **no**. He\\'s taking the straw man version of what lockdown opponents have been saying, and saying \"let\\'s make that the basis for policy.\" We never said that it\\'s OK if grandma dies. OK, one guy did, but he thought that everybody who didn\\'t want to snuff the elderly, disabled and unemployed was a communist.  I think he had issues.  There\\'s a simple, common sense way of implementing social distancing without destroying society or wiping out freedom, and I believe that there is a historical precedent for it. Build more nursing homes and retirement communities far out into the countryside, away from the cities and even the towns, surrounded by nature. Let these places be offered to the most vulnerable of the elderly, without those making the offer losing sight of the difference between vulnerability and incompetence and without forcing them on anybody who is mentally competent. If grandma and grandpa want to take their chances in that apartment in the city that they love, that\\'s their call to make and ours to respect. Offer the place of refuge to them, but don\\'t try to push them into it.  Spend a little money on these peaceful places, and connect them to the population centers by relatively high speed rail, dedicated to limited use. No tourists. Just those working at these homes and those visiting specific people living at them would be allowed to board. Protect those most vulnerable to the novel contagions that arise by putting them at a safer distance from the spread of those contagions. Be sure to remember that the objective of this is not merely to keep a collection of aging bodies alive, but in every sense to keep the souls alive as well, by nurturing them. Don\\'t make these into blandly institutional, authoritarian places of exile, put together based on some ignorant idea that senility is the inevitable consequence of growing old, and that the elderly are without mind or passion, uniformly oblivious to their surroundings. We shall all know better than to think that, by now. Have places of entertainment that those staying in these homes can visit without traveling far, real libraries and advocates for their rights overseeing the homes, so that if some bully with a white coat decides to overpower and impose his will on a resident more than capable of making his own decisions, at the very least, he\\'ll find himself in prison in short order.  Then tell any conservative whining about the expense to sit down and shut up. We have a world in which to live because the previous generations left it to us. We owe those older generations a debt. So let\\'s start repaying it by making sure that our parents and great-grandparents don\\'t just have a fair chance to go on existing, but to really live, even after they and their immune systems have ceased to be as strong as they once were.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  I could be mistaken, but I believe that in centuries past, such places were once known as \"sanitariums,\" before that word became associated with mental institutions. Aside from the part about the relatively high speed rail, which would be made cheaper by the limitation of access (which would allow the cars used on the rail to be smaller and lighter), and the presence of patient advocates, I believe that this is something that was routine in the 19 century, so how can the wealthier 21st century plead poverty as an excuse, as it shortchanges its elders?  As for the patient advocates - that\\'s one check and balance that is long overdue. The elderly have been abused by supposed caretakers for a long time, and that needs to stop. **Now.**',\n",

An old person *might* be able thrive in the relative peace and quiet of a retirement home, having had a lifetime of experiences to look back on. Even in the case of the elderly, that\\'s just a *might*. I\\'m thinking of a family elder who left us at the age of 103 a few years ago, who was out hiking during the day and enjoying the nightlife after dark, who looked like she was ready to kill the moment the words \"old folks home\" were uttered in her presence.  But if one sticks a 20 year old in that retirement home, there can be little doubt: he\\'ll go crazy in there. There\\'s just not going to be enough excitement. The question is what to do about that.  &amp;#x200B;  A few things that were showing up, pre-Covid, come to mind. First of all, very long before Covid, there was a gradual movement of business away from the cities, further out into small towns and even into the countryside. At least in the United States, the days of somebody having to move into a city in order to have a career were being left behind as early as the 1980s. Indeed, young people in that era were known to complain that they were often being forced to do so by the shortage of jobs in the cities.  Since then, telecommuting has become a thing. Automation has been reducing the need for companies to be huge in order to function, meaning that even if the company itself becomes less of a breeding ground for outbreaks, on its own. Especially if it is located in a more remote area.  These trends open up the possibility of the immuno-compromised young person being able to have the freedom to not be a dependent, and be more self-sufficient, more in control of his own life. If they have not shown up in Britain, perhaps they might be encouraged. If those on the Right object, one could perhaps shut them down by arguing that this is also a national defense issue: excessive centralization of the economy makes a country easier to disable during war time. Note the damage done to the British economy by the World War Two bombing of London, then take a good long look at Sarajevo, and remember that war will be back again, someday. It\\'s always just a matter of time.  That should shut them up.  One doesn\\'t have to take the trend to the American extreme that once denied young people the freedom to live where they wished. So long as a significant amount of employment is to be found out in those remote places, the people who need to live out there will have more options in life. Good news for immuno-compromised people. Also, good news for people who\\'d honestly rather live in a remote place in Britain, if there are any of those left. Looking at the population density of the UK, I have to wonder.  Maybe they could emigrate to Australia?  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Work, of course, if not all that a person needs. Something that has been explored in the past, and perhaps could be explored more deeply, is immersive virtual reality. It\\'s not a completely satisfactory substitute for being able to get up and go around as one pleases, but it would have to be a huge improvement over hardly ever hearing another human voice.  In the past, in its cruder earlier forms, it was used for interactive gaming. The gamer would put on a headset, fit something to his hands, and find himself immersed in an illusionary world, along with his fellow players. The illusion would be good enough that one could reach out and feel like one had actually grabbed out to something.  Let\\'s say we update that virtual environment. Present day communications technology allows for live voice streaming of conversations between people on other sides of the planet even on the Second Life platform which is, itself, seriously in need of an update. No appreciable lag can be heard. Animation has advanced, and could be advanced further, to the point at which the virtual world would look more like a real one.  We can\\'t give that unlucky 20 year old a decently working immune system. That\\'s well beyond our capabilities, sad to say. He needs to socially distance to live, even from other immuno-compromised young people. But we can give him a virtual environment in which he can have real conversations with real people, and with a little work, we could let him do so in a setting that would look and feel more like one of those social meeting places that his weakened immune system has been keeping him out of.  Perhaps this would help make life more bearable for him?  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Again, the Right will probably complain about the expense, and again, I think there might be a way to get them to be quiet about that. One could point out that the same technology being allowed to give these formerly socially isolated young people a chance to have the experience of getting out of their homes and mingling, could be used by people who weren\\'t immuno-compromised.  Imagine the savings for business. No longer would there be a need to fly thousands of miles, just for a meeting and a handshake, if people still do those. Just let everybody hook in, meet in virtual space and interact there. One could greatly cut down on commuting, reducing the need for road construction and other transportation infrastructure, and greatly reducing any excuse the government might have to engage in the use of eminent domain.  They\\'ll like that.   Let\\'s say one has family members or old friends living too far away. Now, one could visit them, and bring the kids.  Everybody benefits, not just the sickly few.',\n",

Anybody who doubts this is invited to go ask a physician.  What we are seeing now is not a vaccine in the traditional sense of the word. It makes use of an experimental medical technology. To assert that it must be safe because the word \"vaccine\" has been attached to it is not merely to take up residence in a fantasy world in which vaccine testing is a risk-free proposition, but to engage in magical thinking, as well. It is to imagine that the inherently risky proposition of being a guinea pig in a clinical trial can be made safe, simply through the use of the word \"vaccine.\"  Nature does not care about the labels that corporate shills attach to things.

This is what I would suggest ...  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  First, get an account on [Gab.com](https://Gab.com), also known as [Gab.ai](https://Gab.ai). You will hear lots of tall tales about Gab being filled with neo-Nazis and white supremacists plotting to carry out mass shootings while eating babies, but these are exaggerations. Gab really does take its promises of free speech seriously, and it just stays out of the business of policing user speech unless laws are being broken. Everybody is welcome.  Go over to Gab, and you will find a lot of Lockdown skeptics, one of whom is the owner of the company, a proud conservative Christian named Andrew Torba.  Gab is free. It has roughly a Twitter-like look and functionality, but with greater character limits and, for those with premium accounts, the ability to set up groups. Everybody can join the groups. Most importantly, one can follow other users. If people from this subreddit establish presences on Gab and follow each other, then even if this subreddit gets nuked, they won\\'t lose their connections. Everybody will still be in touch.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  The second part might be slightly trickier. There\\'s a blogging host called \"Deadjournal\" that runs on Danga software, very much like an older version of Livejournal (I think). Again, the owner has a firm commitment to free speech, and he\\'s been living up to his words on that subject for a long time. Since the 90s, I understand - suggesting that he isn\\'t about to have a change of heart.  The only maybe hard part of this is getting an account. If you want a free account, you have to get an invitation from a current user. Paid accounts, on the other hand, are always available, and, I seem to remember, not very expensive.

To attempt to censor a comment without letting the person whose comment is being censored know about it is not acceptable. Enforce the rules if you wish, but going forward, kindly do so in a less sneaky and more ethical manner.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  **One other thing:** I couldn\\'t help but noticing that the anti-intellectual replies stayed up, in clear view of all. So, while I was denied the freedom to tell a female PhD in Biochemistry that there are single male PhDs to be found, the guys who were saying things like \"hey, bebe, them eggheads is lusers, y\\'all need to get a real blue collar man\" were left free to speak, even though rule two mandates civility and an entire class of people was being indiscriminately insulted. That being the case, I don\\'t believe for a second that this moderation was based on anything other than personal bias. I don\\'t think you believe it, either.  If this double standard in rule enforcement was the expression of some belief that well educated people are privileged and should be marginalized for the sake of some fight for the cause of anti-elitism, as far as I\\'m concerned that\\'s more than a problem. That\\'s a deal breaker. As a member of this group, I expect to be treated fairly, and that means that rules for one are rules for all. I am not going to tolerate the idea that I should be treated as a second class member of a subreddit, as the price I have to pay for daring to get an education that, despite the willful ignorance of some to the contrary, is a reflection of years of work, not of privilege.  Anybody who has a problem with that last sentence gets blocked on sight. We\\'re not even going to have a dialog about that subject. I worked my way through school, so get over yourself.   If my status as a PhD candidate means that I am not going to treated like an equal in r/ LockdownSkepticism, then we\\'re done. If that\\'s how this place works, then I\\'m out of here, and I\\'ll be sure to warn other \"eggheads\" to avoid this group, too. You\\'re free to be as arbitrary as you want, but we\\'re free to boycott you and guess what? If you drive off your best educated supporters, your best educated detractors will continue to find their way in here, and your side will start losing a lot more arguments.  If that\\'s your choice, have fun with that.',\n",

It talks of how vaccines will not stop increases in \"case\" numbers that are currently the reason why we\\'re locked down.  &amp;#x200B;  **Commentary from** [**https://lockdownsceptics.org/**](https://lockdownsceptics.org/)**:**  William Haseltine in [*Forbes*](https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhaseltine/2020/09/23/covid-19-vaccine-protocols-reveal-that-trials-are-designed-to-succeed/#1204ab815247) has looked at the trial protocols that four leading vaccine developers, [Moderna](https://www.modernatx.com/sites/default/files/mRNA-1273-P301-Protocol.pdf),\\xa0[Pfizer](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:c5ADYpX1DLcJ:https://pfe-pfizercom-d8-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/2020-09/C4591001_Clinical_Protocol.pdf+&amp;cd=6&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us#28),\\xa0[AstraZeneca](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ctr-med-7111/D8110C00001/52bec400-80f6-4c1b-8791-0483923d0867/c8070a4e-6a9d-46f9-8c32-cece903592b9/D8110C00001_CSP-v2.pdf), and\\xa0[Johnson &amp; Johnson](https://www.jnj.com/coronavirus/covid-19-phase-3-study-clinical-protocol), have published and drawn a shocking conclusion: none of them is aiming to produce a vaccine that prevents infection or reduces likelihood of death.  &gt;***Prevention of infection is\\xa0not\\xa0a criterion for success for any of these vaccines***\\\\*. In fact, their endpoints all require confirmed infections and all those they will include in the analysis for success,\\xa0 the only difference being the severity of symptoms between the vaccinated and unvaccinated. Measuring differences amongst only those infected by SARS-CoV-2 underscores the implicit conclusion that the vaccines are not expected to prevent infection, only modify symptoms of those infected.We all expect an effective vaccine to prevent serious illness if infected. Three of the vaccine protocols – Moderna, Pfizer, and AstraZeneca – do\\xa0not\\xa0require that their vaccine prevent serious disease only that they prevent moderate symptoms which may be as mild as cough, or headache.\\\\*  So mild are the symptoms the vaccines are being tested against that Haseltine dryly remarks: “These vaccine trials are testing to prevent common cold symptoms.”  &gt;*It appears that all the pharmaceutical companies assume that the vaccine will never prevent infection. Their criteria for approval is the difference in symptoms between an infected control group and an infected vaccine group. They do not measure the difference between infection and non-infection as a primary motivation. A greater concern for the millions of older people and those with pre-existing conditions is whether these trials test the vaccine’s ability to prevent severe illness and death. Again we find that severe illness and death are only secondary objectives in these trials. None list the prevention of death and hospitalisation as a critically important barrier.*  He concludes the trials are designed to succeed come what may, which may explain the unusual pace at which they are progressing and the strange sense of confidence that surrounds them, with reports coming out that some vaccines may be [available this year](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-birmingham-54375643).  What it means, though, is that these companies are not creating what most people assume they are creating, namely something that bestows immunity or at least reduces the risk of death. The fact that the prevention of hospitalisation and death – the only reason people are really concerned about Covid, after all – is not a primary aim of the vaccine development is somewhat surprising.  No wonder Haseltine concludes the vaccines currently under trial “will not be the silver bullet needed to end the pandemic”. Do the politicians understand what they are getting? If not, it is incompetence of the highest order as they are wrecking their economies and steamrolling their people’s liberties awaiting drugs that are little more than a glorified version of Lemsip. If they do, why are they making their people languish in ruinous confinement awaiting what is essentially a placebo?  Either way, it has the making of a huge scandal.',\n",

I\\'d worried when I posted here all my arguments would be dismissed as fake news communist propaganda. And I\\'m happy to say that has only happened once to my knowledge. The members of this sub seem to be interested in an actual discussion which I find to be comforting for the future. On the note of healthy discussion I have a question for you all.  What do you think is the biggest problem facing America?  I think that it\\'s that we seem to live in different realities. What I mean by that is on Fox you see guests talking about the left literally want the end of the police and complete anarchy. But on CNN you see guests talking about just what does \"Defund the police\" really means one interpretation is we divert funds from the police to agencies better equipped to handle certain situations that police deal with. For instance we probably want social workers and not police who are untrained in mental health to deal with the naked home less guy screaming in the street about being on mars. I sure don\\'t know how to deal with that better call a professional. In a recent interview Obama mentioned how everyone getting their own news makes it impossible to pass legislation. Obama said I have had Republicans come up to me and say they like my bill and then refuse to vote for it because their voters will hate them because fox has demonized me for years. Also I think anybody who says or actually wants the police to literally be defunded as in no more police is a complete idiot that should know nothing like that is getting past ever according to this Gallup poll 81% of black Americans want the police to stick around. https://news.gallup.com/poll/316571/black-americans-police-retain-local-presence.aspx It\\'s so dumb it\\'s hard to think about what it would look like in reality. As a progressive this is the one of the biggest problems I have with the left terrible marketing is making everything harder. Because when you ask somebody what defund the police actually means it\\'s very rarely no more police.   I\\'m interested to see what you guys think the biggest problem is. And of course let me know of any factual errors in my comment.',\n",

       "    'text': 'Are we in agreement that Democrats usually like spending money? Its usually conservatives that say we need to curb spending despite doing things like the 2017 tax cuts. But we aren\\'t here to talk about that to day. But we can if you like. Anyway if you remember just over a week ago everyone was on board Pelosi, Trump, Schumer with 2000$ checks and then McConnell blocked it for... I don\\'t even know why.   https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/mcconnell-blocks-senate-democrats-move-pass-2-000-coronavirus-checks-n1252483  There were some demoncrats that wanted 2k a month until the pandemic is over. But with a D senate I expect big stimulus.  https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/house-democrats-propose-2000-coronavirus-stimulus-payment-per-month  Edit: I may not be understanding your question completely what is illegal or divisive about saying POC Will receive help. Am I right to assume it\\'s because that statement may leave out white people?  As for the race component it is a bit hard to explain through text so I\\'m going have to write a lot. But in his statement his says women owned businesses and white women certainly own businesses. So this certainly isn\\'t a race thing. At first I can understand hating Democratic rhetoric. I hate it too it\\'s often really bad. Like \"defund the police\" is complete crap since you ask people what does it mean in reality it\\'s never \"get rid of police\". And if they say that is what they mean tell them for me that there a complete idiot that needs to shut up about progressive issues. Since according to this gallup poll about 81% of black people want the police to be around. They just want to be treated fairly.  https://news.gallup.com/poll/316571/black-americans-police-retain-local-presence.aspx?utm_source=tagrss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=syndication  And when I first heard Black Lives Matter I thought it was bad too and thought ALL lives matter would be better. Then I did some research into it. Saying ALM to a group of BLM activists is like going to a group of cancer doctors and saying what about aids, Alzheimer\\'s, diabetes, tuberculosis. They would then say we are not saying those diseases don\\'t matter or aren\\'t real problems. We are just focusing on cancer right now. He is not saying white people don\\'t matter. In that specific instance he was just focused on POC. White people will be attended to. Oh and in the same statement he said women businesses and white women own businesses so again I really don\\'t think this is a race based statement.  Also I\\'m not saying he doesn\\'t know what he is saying. I\\'m saying that when he speaks this is what he means. This is how I interpret it. When I see conservative media. Sometimes it really seems like there is a belief that once the Democrats get control the country will immediately be destroyed. If any of you believe that to be the case how exactly does that happen in reality? What I see happening is a watered down public option, 4 years of arguing over the culture war, I really doubt the supreme court packing or the ending of Fillibuster is really going to happen don\\'t think Biden is down for that. Besides Republicans have a advantage in the Senate and will likely win it back in 2022. Some taxes on people so rich they won\\'t notice them and perhaps a minimum wage increase. None of that will end America.     I don\\'t know the specifics of that clean bill situation. But what I do know is one of the major hangups that made stimulus takes so long is that Democrats wanted to stop Republicans from giving corporations a shield from people suing them for covid related issues. And Republicans wanted to stop Democrats from giving state governments funding. I would assume if your mom died from covid if the corporation did not take proper precautions. Also since the states are getting much less money from taxes they need funding. At least that\\'s what I assume.   Edit: So according to this article one of his issues was that it was socialism for rich people. this adds to my suspicion that the word socialist is just used to describe anything Republicans don\\'t like even when it doesn\\'t even make sense.  https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/31/lindsey-graham-mcconnell-separate-vote-2-000-checks-453015',\n",

But I bet your sure glad you and your children don\\'t have cancer because some guy just HAD to smoke next to you.  TLDR: Please tell me what the big deal is with having to wear a mask.

Are you okay if I give you covid sentencing you to a possible 2 weeks of coughing, bed written with a fever that you could have spent doing anything else. And a possible death sentence for any elderly people you may live with? The crux of the argument is \"Is it okay that my freedom may end your life?\" especially when imo wearing a mask isn\\'t that hard. Are you okay with your grandma dying because I didn\\'t want to wear a mask. Sorry if it sounds like I\\'m being hyperbolic but that\\'s the crux of the argument. If your okay with that the I guess we will have reached the end of our debate.  Side note: Though they appear to be rare I could be a pro life Democrat try not to make assumptions though I don\\'t blame you for making that one Democrats do tend to be prolife .

And no you shouldn\\'t be responsible and yes it would be great if others all read up on news and did the right thing and showed some consideration. But the thing is people just tend to be lazy or they forget or something. Like for example we should all know that Paying taxes to the government is in our best interest to fund the police, school, and such.   But despite that many try to cut taxes at every chance they get some even believe its unethical to tax. Despite when you think about it taxes are just necessary for a functioning society. Fun history tidbit we tried this with the articles of Confederation the founding fathers trusted the colonies to pay taxes and they basically never did causing all sorts of problems.   Another issue was many of the colonies were disrespecting the treaty America had with Britain the colonies should have known that following the treaty is good for the nation but they disrespected it anyway angering Britain. Which leads me to the Crux of my argument \"people will not do things that are in their best interest for a variety of reasons which is why they need to be legally binded to do so\".  And yes politicians ignoring guidelines is pretty scummy esepecially since they are our leaders. But one guy doing bad doesn\\'t mean it\\'s okay for us to do bad. And I don\\'t know if we can tell how strong someone\\'s immune system is at a glance which is why it better to just cover everyone.  Oh and thanks for the rational conversation I find them to be enjoyable. They help sharpen my arguments.',\n",

Anyway definitely the government has tons of waste in multiple places. And places that don\\'t have enough resources. Like in rural America this election has showed just how much rural America doesn\\'t like democrats. That is probably because they have been neglected for years and I hope Biden has a plan to start addressing them since I think if we don\\'t later elections could be lost for Democrats. For instance we definitely need a massive investment in infrastructure since its falling apart all over the country and many rural communities don\\'t have good internet access. Also we need to invest in school in school everywhere but especially in poor America (which sadly tends to overlap with rural America). Since schools are usually funded by property taxes and poor areas don\\'t have high property taxes. This is one of the reasons why rich people are likely to remain rich since when you go to a school that can afford to have lots of teachers and technology and AP classes. You are likely to succeed much more likely then if you go to a school where there are 50 kids in one class room, your textbook is falling apart, or when your teacher decides to not sure up/quit because they are being paid to low.

I give you a hint- ever heard about the Rothschild family?   &amp;#x200B;  its not about the virus, its about control. and elites wanting to stay in power.  look at the bigger picture, when we are arguing on whether to vax or no-vax they are playing with the 'great reset' and transfer of wealth into their pockets.  Jeff Bezos has no interest in ending lockdowns, right?

I never got ill.  never \"infected anyone\" nor heard about anyone who did.   if it was as serious as they say, their propaganda would be unecessary. people would be lining up for the vaccine! they would be screaming \"me me, give it to me over 80yo! they will die soon anyway\"  nothing like this is happening.

But I am against this one. And btw I did my research about vaccines and it only made me more hesitant to the whole big pharma because of this. I started to dig for information.  why take it if it doesnt stop the spread, doesnt prevent you from catching the virus, and only lowers its symptoms which basically were none from everyone I met? with unknown long term health effects? Like, Im not living healthy and caring about my body just to suddenly inject it with experimental potion, advertise it anyway. Instead they sabotaging people by saying you wont be able to participate in society. Well prove to me that people who arent having symptoms really spread the disease and infect others - because those people can actually spread immunity to the virus, by spreading old, or weakened parts of the virus, as always with herd immunity in the past.  &amp;#x200B;  btw, what happened in Sweden or Belarus?

(please watch planet lockdown interview with Catherine, this one: https://earthheroestv.com/programs/catherine-austin-fitts-full-interview-planet-lockdownmp4-508b4a please watch it in full before making any claims or conclusions - its one system. social distancing will be implemented permanently to your workforce, outside of your homes etc.. its basically a new way of how society will function , with 5G and IoT playing v important role in it  - IOT - yes youre right, not all got connection. This will change in several years from now on, maximum.  - the fact that a cellphone ALREADY tracks us to an extent, doesnt make this issue less important, it doesnt make it go away either. it makes it MORE important because in 5G and also internet being beamed up from the Musk satellites (and others) there WOULD NOT BE A WAY TO ESCAPE THIS SYSTEM. Today I can still leave my phone in the house.  In this system, you wont be able to shop, travel, purchase or sell anything, go to your work etc. without your tracking device at all because you will be denied access. Cash will be rolled out and replaced with crypto currencies, which are just another layer of this system.  Crypto was sold to people as some sort of freedom from banks. Yes, temporarily. Wait until they make illegal to pay for anything by using nothing else but govt issued crypto. This is still several years from now.  They ''allow'' people to make millions in crypto, that will only inflate the whole FIAT economy even more and then collapse it. Then introduce ''safe govt based crypto''. After all, they are doing it right now - cyber Chinese YUAN is just one example, cyber EUR is to follow too.\",\n",

       "    'text': '# England Restrictions Review/Roadmap Megathread  The government plans to set out the roadmap today for how restrictions will be eased in England. Please keep all conversation on this topic in this thread.  We have heard your feedback on contest mode, and have listened: We will not use contest mode on this thread, and will set default sorting to \"new\". To allow for this, we will keep scores hidden for longer than usual for the next couple days.  ## Notes on speculation prior to the announcement:  Anything said before the announcement should be phrased in a speculative manner. That means \"I *think*/*hope* this will happen\". **Anything phrased to imply \"this** ***will*** **happen\" or to that effect must be accompanied by a source to a reputable source.** Said reputable source must not simply be quoting a leak (which may or may not be accurate) or speculative in nature (i.e. quoting a speculative BBC article is not a good enough source for your assertions).  **For your own mental health, and the mental health of others, we implore you not to jump to any conclusions on rumours**. The announcement is not expected until after 3:30 in parliament, with a further press conference later in the day, so hold on to your hats and your horses (please).  ## Notes on discussion after the announcement:  This will be the first proper announcement on the exit strategy for England. Anything up until this point has been suggestions. Unfortunately, many newspapers have taken these suggestions as gospel, and have riled people up. If the main point of your comment is to complain about \"goalposts\" being shifted that weren\\'t even established until today, then there is a fair chance your comment will be removed. That doesn\\'t mean you aren\\'t allowed to be disappointed by whatever is announced, it\\'s simply to say that the \"goalposts\" meme has gone on long enough.  A final note on discussion after the announcement, in the form of a quote from [Covid Fact Check UK](https://twitter.com/fact_covid/status/1363041527849771008) on twitter:  &gt;Many will be very angry, and call for lockdown to end straight away.  Those on the opposite extreme will say we’re relaxing too fast and risking another wave.  The great majority will be somewhere in-between. You won’t hear as much from them on here.  ## Confirmed details on the roadmap:  * Today\\'s measures apply to England, but working with other devolved administrations * Both vaccines providing a good level of protection * No vaccines can ever be 100% effective * Lifting lockdown will result in more cases, hospitalisations and deaths, as shown by todays SAGE * No credible route to a zero COVID Britain or indeed zero covid world * Cautious but irreversible * 1st dose for every adult by end of July * More vaccines = Less restrictions * R rate similar across UK so will ease across the UK at the same time * Outdoor activity first * Led by data not dates, will review data before each step * At least 5 weeks between each step to allow time to review and give time to prepare. Moving faster would mean acting before we know the impact of each step and risking having to go back. * Step 1 - 8th March - Schools open (all schools &amp; Edu) twice weekly tesing for secondary schools. Breakfast and after school clubs can reopen. Children\\'s sport can also restart. Uni requiring on-site can return, not the others. People meet 1 person from non-household for outdoor (non exercise) recreation * Step 1, part 2 - 29th March - Meet in ltd numbers outdoors inc gardens (rule of 6 OR 2 families). Outdoor sports resume. Stay at home ends, WFH if you can and minimise travel * Step 2 - 12th April at the earliest - Non essential retail including salons reopen, Gyms reopen, Holiday lets reopen, Zoos, theme parks, drive in cinemas, Outdoor pubs &amp; restaurants reopen with no curfew or scotch egg requirements * Step 3 - 17th May earliest - Meetings outdoors up to 30 people ok, Friends &amp; family indoors (2 families OR rule of 6), Pubs &amp; restaurants indoors, Cinemas, indoor play areas, hotels, hostels, theatres and concert halls * Step 4 - no earlier than 24th June - Remove all legal limits on social contacts &amp; weddings/ live events, Reopen everything upto &amp; including nightclubs  NEW POST: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/lprfn0/covid19\\\\_boris\\\\_johnson\\\\_plans\\\\_to\\\\_reopen\\\\_shops\\\\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/lprfn0/covid19_boris_johnson_plans_to_reopen_shops_and/) this is the news story summarising the changes  ## Links to rolling news sources:  [BBC Live Thread](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-56149494)  [Watch Live on iPlayer at BBC Parliament from 15:30](https://www.bbc.co.uk/tv/bbcparliament)',\n",

       "    'text': 'Follow up tweet: In France, January’s birth rate was lowest it has been since the series first published decades ago, and comfortably the biggest year-on-year fall.  Fantastic reporting from @VJMallet @danieldombey  @MAmdorsky @MilesMJohnson @rmilneNordic @JohnReedwrites https://www.ft.com/content/bc825399-345c-47b8-82e7-6473a1c9a861  &gt;\\tIt is not just that many more people are dying as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. In several countries, considerably fewer are being born.  &gt;France’s national statistics institute was one of the first to publish figures for the number of children born in January — nine months after the country was stuck in its first Covid-19 lockdown — and the provisional data show a startling decline: there were 53,900 births in the month, 13 per cent down on the figure for January 2020.\\xa0  &gt;\\tFor France, a country that has traditionally had the highest fertility rate in the 27-member EU, it marked the biggest fall in births since the abrupt end of the baby boom in the 1970s.  &gt;Births had also fallen 7 per cent in the previous month compared with the same period a year earlier, leaving the total number of babies born in France last year, 735,000, at the lowest level since the end of the second world war.  &gt;\\t“There are a lot of fantasies that when couples find themselves at home they will have more children. But that is something of an idyllic vision,” said Anne Solaz of Ined, France’s National Institute of Demographic Studies. “In fact there are some who find it hard being together all the time.”\\xa0  &gt;Preliminary data also show sharp declines in the number of births in Spain and Italy, two countries already facing the challenge of ageing populations. Evidence points to similar trends in the UK and the US, too.  &gt;A collapse in the number of newborns in industrialised economies following a pandemic or an economic crisis — such as the depression of the 1930s or the 1973 oil crisis — is not usually a surprise to demographers. Potential parents are typically anxious about job security and their ability to support their offspring.\\xa0  &gt;“What’s different this time is that the fall in births is really big,” said Arnaud Regnier-Loilier, Ined’s director of research. “It’s a bit unprecedented, but the crisis is also unprecedented.”\\xa0  &gt;He pointed to the “great anguish” and “climate of fear” last year as people worried not only about their livelihoods but also the risk — now known to be very slight — of young children falling sick from the virus.  &gt;Italy, the first European country to feel the full force of the Covid-19 crisis, recorded 21.6 per cent fewer births in December — nine months after the country went into lockdown — compared with the same month the year before.  &gt;For 2020 as a whole, Italy’s national statistical agency Istat said there were about 400,000 births, down from 420,000 the year before, while the country recorded 647,000 deaths — leaving the largest gap between the two since the Spanish flu outbreak of 1918.  &gt;Istat has linked the collapse in births to the collapse in the number of weddings, which fell by more than 50 per cent in the first 10 months of last year, meaning couples were less likely to try for a baby before they were able to hold their nuptials.\\xa0  &gt;France, too, recorded fewer marriages last year. They were down 34 per cent from 2019, largely because wedding celebrations were first forbidden and then subject to restrictions on guest numbers.\\xa0  &gt;In figures published on Wednesday, Spain’s statistical institute estimated that childbirths dropped by 20 per cent in December and January compared with the same months a year before.\\xa0It added that December’s total of 23,266 births in Spain was the lowest for any month since 1941, when its records began.  &gt;The size of the drop highlights the likely impact of Spain’s harsh 2020 lockdown, which was at its toughest in March and April, nine months before the precipitous fall in births.  &gt;If the “baby bust” were to persist, it would have profound implications for economies and societies, affecting everything from immigration to education and pensions. Yet it is not necessarily a worldwide phenomenon.\\xa0  &gt;The pandemic appears to have triggered a birth boom in the Philippines, with the UN warning that the difficulty of obtaining contraception and medical attention has led to a surge in unwanted pregnancies and deaths in childbirth.  &gt;There are also signs that some northern European countries have either been unaffected or may have experienced the opposite of the trend noted in France, Italy and Spain.\\xa0  &gt;Sweden recorded a 6.4 per cent drop in the number of births in January, according to figures published this week by the country’s statistics office, but the Netherlands and Finland both reversed years of decline and reported slight year-on-year increases in new babies recorded in January.\\xa0  &gt;Covid-19 did not hit the Nordic nations and parts of northern Europe as hard as some other countries, particularly early on, which may explain why birth rates were higher there at the start of this year.  &gt;A question now is whether the falls in births in the affected countries are a temporary blip or a trend that will persist. “Generally, when there are crises, once they are past there is a tendency to return to a fertility level that is close to or higher than before the crisis,” said Regnier-Loilier.\\xa0  &gt;However, Teresa Castro, a demographer at Spain’s national research council, predicted births for the whole of 2021 could fall very significantly.\\xa0  &gt;“I don’t think this is a transitory phenomenon,” she said. “Uncertainties are one of the leading reasons why people don’t have children. And people are still confronting significant health, and in particular economic, uncertainties.”',\n",

       "    'text': '2: It’s worth looking beneath the surface at what has driven that steep decline, as it’s far from a one-size-fits all explanation.  In some countries — the UK being the most striking — restrictions have done a lot of the heavy lifting, and this is about adherence as much as policy. https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1364963307841613835/photo/1  3: But elsewhere — particularly India &amp; South Africa — the scale of previous waves means levels of natural immunity are *much* higher than anything we’ve seen in UK or elsewhere in developed world.  In these areas, antibodies &amp; T-cells will have done a lot more of the heavy lifting. https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1364963313042546690/photo/1  4: Before anyone says \"see, we should have stayed open\", South Africa has among the highest excess mortality in the world, much higher than UK. India also suffered very high excess deaths.  If you’ve got lots of natural immunity, it can help you. But it doesn’t come cheap.  5: The much-discussed comparison of California vs Florida is another good demonstration of the nuances of how a wave of infection is brought low  CA had restrictions, FL did not. FL also had higher levels of pre-existing immunity.  Infections fell in both, but faster &amp; further in CA https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1364963319967326211/photo/1  6: And now, a plot twist:  You’ll recall I said global cases had fallen steeply to Feb 18.  It’s now Feb 25, and cases are on the rise again, up 5% over the last 6 days.  This is a much faster rebound than what we saw last spring/summer, where the fall went further and lasted months https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1364963325025660928/photo/1  7: And a closer look at where cases are rising again and what’s happening in those countries shows the risk of assuming we’re all now on the home stretch. https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1364963330146861060/photo/1  8: Tight restrictions and high levels of natural immunity can bring infections low and keep them there; half measures can’t.  Take France: after lockdown in November restrictions were relaxed, and have been much looser than UK since. Antibody prevalence also much lower. The results: https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1364963334915842054/photo/1  9: Brazil is another cautionary tale. Minimal restrictions for months, and reports of herd immunity greatly exaggerated ⬇️ Thousands of excess deaths every week for a year as the epidemic smoulders on. Even in Manaus, once the symbol of herd immunity, resurgence sent deaths soaring https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1364963339974148104/photo/1  10: (For more on Manaus, see @WesPegden’s debunking of one study that claimed antibody prevalence of 76% there https://twitter.com/WesPegden/status/1336801382955933697  A fully randomised follow-up study found the peak was more like 15% https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30387-9/fulltext#supplementaryMaterial)  11: And to those who look at the ongoing resurgences in France and Eastern Europe and say, \"yes but we have vaccines now, so we don’t care about cases anymore because they won’t make people seriously ill\", I would say the following:  12: 1) I suspect most people reading this tweet live in the UK or US, both of which are near the top of the vaccination leader-board. Most people live elsewhere.  UK has given at least one dose to 6x more of its population than France or Czech Republic, both experiencing resurgences. https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1364963347934965765/photo/1  13: 2) Large parts of Europe are struggling to administer their vaccines to a wary public, in some cases having fanned the flames of vaccine hesitancy themselves.  France has more than half of its 7.7m vaccines sitting in cold storage https://www.ft.com/content/f009d255-8a7d-4bd1-8bfa-0d49b9647a71 https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1364963354176090113/photo/1  14: 3) And the resurgences we’re already seeing are not just in cases. Hospital admissions are rising again in much of Eastern Europe https://www.ft.com/content/82386351-ef22-4b3b-902e-3303de95fac6 https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1364963359888715779/photo/1  15: To conclude:  Every day brings more good vaccine news, but it’ll be months (in rich countries) or years (in poorer countries) before people have these vaccines in their arms.  Covid is not taking a break in the meantime.  Our story, with @AnnaSophieGross https://www.ft.com/content/f671f030-1b09-4c1e-ade6-111c2cd22622  16: As we continue to track positive news about vaccine development and watch protective effects show up in UK &amp; US as they have in Israel, we must not forget about the millions in Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Latin America who continue to face a deadly virus largely unprotected.  17: Finally a footnote:  Antibody prevalence doesn’t capture other indicators of immunity e.g T-cells. This means % of people with some immunity will be higher than antibody prevalence, but it doesn’t change the fact that natural immunity levels are far higher in SA &amp; IND than UK etc',\n",

       "    'text': 'I like the idea of an “independent” SAGE but I think it’s important to note a few things.   1) SAGE is independent but they tell the government their views and the government then decide on what to act on. I have colleagues who work with some of them and get the impression they were pushing to do more earlier but the government and the behavioural scientists were slower to act as they didn’t think we would accept a lockdown as well as we did.  2) “independent SAGE” does not appear particularly independent. There’s a reason these people joined this group. If they agreed with what the government was doing then they wouldn’t have started it so by their very nature they would always be likely to disagree with the government’s decisions.  3) there are far fewer members than actual SAGE on Independent SAGE. Each member on Independent SAGE is the only expert in that particular aspect, whereas SAGE has multiple overlapping people which means topics can be debated and then the group can decide the overall recommendation. Having a single voice means if they are biased there is no one necessarily able to question them. I watched the first one and half the members didn’t know the difference between R and R0 so whilst they are experts in their own fields they can’t necessarily fact-check the claims of others if presented in a biased way.   Regarding face masks there is some evidence. It isn’t great. But at the same time it is a simple thing that isn’t going to harm and could provide a bit of benefit. Simpler messages are key though otherwise they are confusing. We have seen enough of that during this pandemic so I’m not particularly impressed with independent SAGEs views on this.',\n",

       "    'text': 'All instances have been within 16 days of the vaccine, and you would expect symptoms to show up prior to that.   This is the guidance on the MHRA Site:  ### Blood clots  The MHRA has undertaken a thorough review into UK reports of an extremely rare and unlikely to occur specific type of blood clot in the brain, known as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) occurring together with low levels of platelets (thrombocytopenia) following vaccination with the COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca. It is also considering other blood clotting cases (thromboembolic events) alongside low platelet levels.  On the basis of this ongoing scientific review, it has concluded that the evidence of a link with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca is stronger but more work is still needed.  As a precaution, administration of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca in people of any age who are at higher risk of blood clots because of their medical condition should be considered only if benefits from the protection from COVID-19 infection outweighs potential risks.  Anyone who experienced cerebral or other major blood clots occurring with low levels of platelets after their first vaccine dose of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca should not have their second dose. Anyone who did not have these side effects should come forward for their second dose when invited.  The MHRA recently confirmed that the evidence to date does not suggest that the COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca causes venous thromboembolism without a low platelet count.  While the MHRA continues to investigate these cases, as a precautionary measure anyone that develops symptoms after vaccination is advised to seek prompt medical advice, such as:  * **shortness of breath, chest or persistent abdominal pain, leg swelling** * **blurred vision, confusion or seizures** * **unexplained pin-prick rash or bruising beyond the injection site**  Furthermore anybody with **new onset of severe or persistent headache that does not respond to simple painkillers starting four days or more after vaccination should speak to their doctor.**',\n",

They are best placed to comment on the safety of this vaccine and I would encourage you to listen to them rather than random people on Reddit claiming to know there is a link when at the moment it hasn’t even been shown as definitely causal.   To everyone else - this is why it is so important to stop speculating. You may think it is harmless discussion but it is not. If people get scared because of comments you make they might be too scared to take a vaccine and that puts themselves and others at risk.',\n",

It is also considering other blood clotting cases (thromboembolic events) alongside low platelet levels.  On the basis of this ongoing scientific review, it has concluded that the evidence of a link with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca is stronger but more work is still needed.  As a precaution, administration of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca in people of any age who are at higher risk of blood clots because of their medical condition should be considered only if benefits from the protection from COVID-19 infection outweighs potential risks.  Anyone who experienced cerebral or other major blood clots occurring with low levels of platelets after their first vaccine dose of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca should not have their second dose. Anyone who did not have these side effects should come forward for their second dose when invited.  The MHRA recently confirmed that the evidence to date does not suggest that the COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca causes venous thromboembolism without a low platelet count.  While the MHRA continues to investigate these cases, **as a precautionary measure anyone that develops symptoms after vaccination is advised to seek prompt medical advice, such as:**  * **shortness of breath, chest or persistent abdominal pain, leg swelling** * **blurred vision, confusion or seizures** * **unexplained pin-prick rash or bruising beyond the injection site**  Furthermore anybody with **new onset of severe or persistent headache that does not respond to simple painkillers starting four days or more after vaccination should speak to their doctor.**',\n",

They rage about the issues they see in their head that were not explicitly addressed in the rumour but then further announcements clarify things which negates all that rage. So it all feels rather manufactured.   Example:  “Vaccine passports would discriminate against those who can’t take a vaccine for medical reasons”  Rage ensues  It gets clarified that obviously any certification system would take into account that not everyone can take the vaccine so there would need to be alternatives in place  Rage subsided but then turns to another issue  Again clarification  Etc  It just feels like maybe people should take a beat and ask questions but not jump straight into the rage and vitriol we have seen on what is still an unannounced (and only potential, given it is being trialed but with no guarantees of implementation) policy.',\n",

It can be a bit difficult to define, especially in the limited space on the rules.   In terms of good faith if someone is coming here and actively debating, listening to others views and providing counters and generally adding to the conversation then that would be viewed as being done in good faith. There are plenty who manage this daily where they do not necessarily agree with the others they are debating with but it is clear it is a conversation that’s being had.   Then theres people coming in and pushing their view points on others. Refusing to listen or to actively engage in a discussion. That is not engaging in good faith.   Personally, I very rarely ban someone for the “not in good faith” rule from a single comment. It is more a collective assessment based on overall contribution to the sub. Is the person constantly commenting only on one issue etc. It can be hard to define though.   The main way we deal with this is by discussing most of these cases with other mods. We have our own discord server and we spend a lot of time on there as well as doing the actual mod work of clearing our mod queue etc. We discuss issues we are seeing cropping up, we ask others for their views on a particular user we think may not be acting in good faith and see if there is a consensus. There’s plenty of times where one of us may query something and others point out things we are missing (either good or bad!).   Regarding removed comments - if you have had some comments removed that you would like to discuss then please feel free to message us in modmail and we can look at them again (top tip to anyone else reading it - if you also delete the comment we cannot see it anymore, which makes it impossible for us to give a second opinion. That doesn’t work in your favour as we literally cannot help in that situation). If you see comments from others removed please know there’s a range of reasons for this. Sometimes it is for something obviously rule breaking like misinformation (occasionally this is accidental and we give people an opportunity to fix it and then we reinstate the comment); sometimes it may seem like a totally reasonable comment has been deleted but what you can’t tell is that it has been posted by a ban evader that we have identified and therefore given they are banned from the sub on their main account any comments by their alts are deleted.   Finally, I would say that things regularly get caught in our filters that I vehemently disagree with. But I still approve the comments on the sub because me not agreeing with the comment does not make it rule breaking. And I know this happens multiple times a day for other mods too. We do try to ensure that various sides of a debate are heard. But occasionally we won’t get this right. If you think something has been deleted when it shouldn’t have been please do reply to the deletion message and as long as you ask politely we can take another look.',\n",

The nuclear football is actually of secondary importance when it comes to ordering a nuclear strike - of first importance is the plastic card with a code that’s used to verify the president’s identification to the SecDef when he gives the order. The VP also has a football assigned to him, but I believe the president is the only one who receives an activated code, and then code activation follows the line of succession in the instance that the President is killed.     Pelosi has stated that she received assurances from Gen. Milley that “safeguards” were in place to prevent Trump from launching a nuke at, say, Twitter HQ in the final weeks of his presidency.  I personally believe that responsibility has been quietly transferred to Pence, or at the very least, both have active codes and the order is verified as being genuine only when both codes are provided.      Prior to the inauguration ceremony, the incoming president is given a code card that is automatically activated at noon when he takes command, so an actual physical “handing over” of the football from the president to his successor isn’t necessary. Even if Pence *wasn’t* attending (and presumably relinquishing his football to Biden) there’s actually a third football kept at the White House that could be assigned to Biden at noon, in which case both Pence and Trump’s aides would immediately return to DC with the other two.',\n",

The cops in front of the door and the guys in the stairs were purposely getting out of the way so the officer in the corridor would have a clean shot. You can even see one of the tactical guys giving the officer in the hall a thumbs up once Babbitt’s down, letting him know he got a direct hit.      LPT for any wanna-be insurrectionists: if you’re trying to break down a door to get a high ranking government official and the authorities blocking that door suddenly move tf out of the way, they AREN’T doing it for your convenience.',\n",
